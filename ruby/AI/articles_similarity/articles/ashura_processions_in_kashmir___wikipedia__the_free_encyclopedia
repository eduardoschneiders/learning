However, in the state capital of Srinagar, processions are not allowed along the traditional route–that begins at Abi Guzar, passes through Maisuma, and ends at Zadibal–and the occasion is often marred by clashes between the mourners and the police.[2][3][4] The government privately cites fear of militant strikes as a reason for the restrictions.[1] Shia leaders in the state, such as Mohammad Abbas Ansari, complain that the restrictions are discriminatory and impinge of their freedom of religion.[1][5] References[edit]   ^ a b c Islamic Republic News Agency (17 December 2010).
