In 1922 state powers of the institution were technically somewhat superseded by the Council of People's Commissars of USSR. By September 1917, the councils (soviets) of workers, peasants and soldiers acquired considerable political and military power. The leaders of the Petrograd Soviet conspired to overthrow the Russian Provisional Government; the uprising started on 7 November 1917, when Red Guards units captured the Winter Palace. On the next day, 8 November 1917, the Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets recognized the success of the uprising, and formally established the new government that reflected the capture of the soviets by the Bolsheviks. The government was formally called the Council of People's Commissars (Совет народных коммиссаров), abbreviated as Sovnarkom (Совнарком). It was Leon Trotsky who devised the council and commissar names, thereby avoiding the more "bourgeois" terms, minister and cabinet. The People's Commissars (Russian: Народный комиссар, translit.: Narodny komissar, or Narkom) functioned as government ministers; a ministry was therefore called a People's Commissariat (Russian: Народный комиссариат, translit.: Narodny komissariat, abbreviated to narkomat). Formation[edit]     A Sovnarkom session between December 1917 and January 1918, with (from the left) Isaac Steinberg, Ivan Skvortsov-Stepanov, Boris Kamkov, Vladimir Bonch-Bruyevich, V.E. Trutovsky, Alexander Shlyapnikov, P.P. Proshyan, Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin, Alexandra Kollontai, Pavel Dybenko, E.K. Kosharova, Nikolai Podvoisky, Nikolai Gorbunov, V.I. Nevsky, Alexander Shotman, Georgy Chicherin   Traditionally, a government is a council of ministers nominated by a ruler or by a president, but the Bolsheviks saw this as a bourgeois institution, and wanted to create what they thought a new government of workers and peasants, a 'soviet' government. The role and structure of the Sovnarkom was formalized in the 1918 Constitution of the RSFSR. The Sovnarkom of the RSFSR was responsible to the Congress of Soviets for the "general administration of the affairs of the state". The constitution enabled the Sovnarkom to issue decrees carrying the full force of law when the Congress was not in session. The Congress then routinely approved these decrees at its next session. Each People's Commissar was head of commissariat and had several deputies and a collegium which functioned as a deliberative body to advise the commissar. The Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, also elected by the Congress, had a function similar to that of a prime minister. The first Chairman of the Sovnarkom was Vladimir Lenin. The original People's Commissars[edit] The first council elected by the Second All-Russian congress was composed as follows:   People's Commissar Original incumbent Death   Chairman Vladimir Lenin Natural causes 1924   Executive Officer Nikolai Gorbunov Executed 1938   People's Commissariat for Agriculture of the RSFSR Vladimir Milyutin Died in prison 1937   People's Commissariat for Military Affairs of the RSFSR Vladimir Antonov-Ovseyenko Nikolai Krylenko  Executed 1939 Executed 1938    People's Commissariat for Naval Affairs of the RSFSR Pavel Dybenko Executed 1938   People's Commissariat for Trade and Industry of the RSFSR Viktor Nogin Natural causes 1924   People's Commissariat for Education of the RSFSR Anatoly Lunacharsky Natural causes 1933   People's Commissariat for Food Ivan Teodorovich Executed 1937   People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs of the RSFSR Leon Trotsky Assassinated 1940   People's Commissariat for Interior Affairs of the RSFSR Alexei Rykov Executed 1938   People's Commissariat for Justice of the RSFSR Georgy Oppokov Executed 1938   People's Commissariat for Labour of the RSFSR Alexander Shlyapnikov Executed 1937   People's Commissariat of Nationalities Joseph Stalin Natural causes 1953   People's Commissariat for Posts and Telegraphs of the RSFSR Nikolai Glebov-Avilov Executed 1937   People's Commissariat for Railways of the RSFSR (vacant)    People's Commissariat for Finance Ivan Skvortsov-Stepanov Natural causes 1928   Council of Ministers[edit] The Council of People's Commissars was renamed Council of Ministers in 1946.
