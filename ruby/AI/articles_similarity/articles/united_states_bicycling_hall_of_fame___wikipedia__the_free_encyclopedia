The Hall announced in April 2009 that it would move to Davis.[1] The grand opening of the new downtown Davis facility was on April 24, 2010. The hall of fame joined a collection of historic bicycles that were already located in Davis. Davis has an extensive bicycling infrastructure, culture and legacy. It replaced the 3rd and B teens center, which was a slightly controversial move among the teenage population of Davis, but many of its functions, such as dances, were moved to the Veteran's Memorial Center. Museum[edit] The Hall of Fame is located on the top floor of the building and includes the bicycles of Major Taylor and Frank Louis Kramer as well as a championship sash and medals from Frank Kramer. The main floor of the museum includes topical exhibits. In 2010, there was an exhibit about the Tour of California and a display about Greg LeMond. The basement includes an extensive display of historic bicycles that includes Draisine and Velocipede models. The display also includes landmark bicycles from the 1950s through the present that illustrate the rapid recent evolution of the bicycle.
