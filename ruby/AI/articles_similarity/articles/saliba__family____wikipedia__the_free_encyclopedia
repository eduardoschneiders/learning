          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                            Jump to:     navigation,      search          Saliba (also spelled Saleeby, Saleeba or Salibi) is a predominantly Christian family name used in Levant. The family name is derived from the Syriac ܨܠܝܒܐ ṣalībā, which cognates with saleeb an Arabic word for cross, a reference to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ.[1] The family names Saleeby and Saliba have been in use by this family in Palestine, Lebanon and Syria since at least the 2nd century AD. It is erroneous to write that this family is of any descent from crusaders. The crusaders were known by the name "Salebayeen". The written family history of the Saliba/Saleeby family of Lebanon/Syria makes mention of how they defended themselves against these crusaders who attacked Muslim, Jew and Christian alike. The Saliba/Saleeby family traces its paternal lineage back to ancient Sparta. In their family lands above the modern town of Bteghrine, Lebanon, is an area known as "Sparta". Many centuries ago the family named it that after moving there from where they lived in Greece and building on the land. It is only ruins today but still carries the old name. The Knights of Malta were known to be experts in cavalry and those who joined the Crusaders in their crusade to the Holy Land and stayed became known as Salebayeen. These are often incorrectly assumed by modern authors to be the same family.    Contents   1 Notable people 2 See also 3 References 4 External links    Notable people[edit]  Saliba   George A.
