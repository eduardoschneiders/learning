It was the successor of the Wartburg 311, and was itself succeeded by the Wartburg 1.3. The Wartburg 353 was produced from 1966 to 1988, becoming the model with the longest-ever production run. During its lifetime it saw several changes and improvements, the most recognizable of these coming in 1985 with a front facelift (as pictured here), slightly different layout around the engine block and a new carburetor. The Wartburg 353 was the creation of the former German BMW production facilities (called EMW under Soviet occupation). It was based on a 1938 design, and powered by an engine with only seven major moving parts, crankshaft included. Popular saying among owners hence that one drives a car but only maintains a motorcycle. Domestically, it was used for government transportation, sometimes as a police car. Delivery of consumer builds often could take ten to fifteen years. Like other Eastern European cars, it was known for its low price and comparatively well-equipped design. Because of its forward centre of gravity and front-wheel drive, the car had specific road handling, sometimes displaying significant understeer, especially in wet conditions.[citation needed] Wartburgs were exported to most continental European markets and also to the UK, Cyprus, Malta, and South Africa.

While developing about 55-57 bhp (depending on the carburetor type) its two-stroke engine design provided more than 100 N/m of torque (106 N/m in the last version). Typical figure for quite larger four-stroke engine at that time, it accelerated the less than a ton vehicle pretty decently even by modern standards. The transmission was equipped with a freewheel, obviating the need to use the clutch between gears. This turned out so popular with owners that it has become almost symbolic for a 353, along with the gear stick on the steering column. Designed as a fuel efficiency measure and as means of protecting the engine from oil starvation, the device disabled engine braking; the car effectively coasted whenever the throttle was released. Drivers had the option of turning the freewheel off through a switch under the steering column to benefit from engine braking. Useful since the front brakes were prone to overheating and fading. However, most drivers never disabled the freewheel, because it made shifting gears significantly easier and smoother, though not quicker. It is notable that even today the 353s are customized for reaching speeds well about 200 km/h (125 mph), whereas the original design called for critical speed of 150–155 km/h and 12 seconds to accelerate to 100 km/h (62 mph), which was dealt with in second gear due to the high-rev engine. It was available both with 4+1 and 5+1 steps gearbox. Popularity[edit]      This section appears to contradict itself. Please see the talk page for more information. (June 2015)   The 353 was an immediate success throughout the Eastern bloc, and with good reason; for approximately the same price, it significantly outperformed Soviet vehicles of its class in almost every aspect: safety, drag, acceleration, top speed, fuel efficiency, ergonomics, handling, ease of use, maintenance, trunk and inner space, off-road capability, and even dynamics, despite its less powerful engine. Evidence of the latter are multiple rally wins it scored over the course of decades, whereas the more powerful Ladas and Moskvitches usually failed to achieve success.[dubious – discuss] The Wartburg 353 was commonly nicknamed "Trustworthy Hans" or "Farty Hans" by owners due to its durability and copious exhaust emissions, especially when cold and/or overoiled. Noteworthy characteristics of the model are: simple design, dependability, occasional and cheap maintenance, strong chassis-based car frame, front-wheel drive, rear wheel ABS regulator, a 525-litre trunk, innovative electronic gauges fitted after 1983. Disadvantages in terms of passengers' comfort are well known too: lack of any sound dampers led to significant engine feedback in the coupe which itself was in turn very boomy and reverberating, leading to another nickname, "The barrel". This left very few Wartburgs equipped with stereo because it was not possible to enjoy that at volumes most people do, over the engine noise. Suspension provided for sensibly different handling and comfort when the car was empty over when it was carrying passengers and luggage. Owners' accounts are that both control and smoothness went better the more the car was loaded. It was also available as a pickup version named WARTBURG 353 TRANS, but was not very successful, mainly due to limited payload (only 450 kg) and low volume of transport. It was mainly used for small deliveries. Production[edit] Over a million Wartburg 353s were produced overall. Production figures (1966–1988):  1966–1975 Wartburg 353, 356,330 1975–1988 Wartburg 353 W, 868,860  Model Development[edit] The transition model Wartburg 312 with the body of the Wartburg 311 and the frame of the later Wartburg 353 was on September 1, 1965. the VIN introduced 65,533. From June 1, 1966, vehicles from VIN 1:30 001 received the new body, associated with a change in the type designation of "1000" to "353". A new transmission received since July 1, 1966 all vehicles from chassis number 001 02:14. The introduction of the hatchback Wartburg Tourist with the VEB Karosseriewerke Halle (Saale) made body was carried in 1968. tailgate and rear fenders were made of glass fiber reinforced plastic manufactured. First, the tourist was manufactured with closed C-pillar, 1970 has been a forced ventilation system with air outlets in the C-pillar introduced. From chassis number 474 took place on 6 May 04:10 1969 introduction of the new engine type 353-1 with 36.8 kW. Since March 3, 1975 / From Chassis No 10.06 948 the vehicle was as Wartburg 353 W with disc brakes front and produced many detail changes. The body remained unchanged. From 17:20 VIN 932 to the vehicles produced since June 14, 1982 possessed a carburetor type Jikov 32 Sedr with pre-heated intake mixture (by the upgrading of older models is not recommended), new brake drums rear and H4 headlights . From 2 January 1984 to the "S" instead of the previous version "de luxe" was produced from VIN 19:00 401. The special design was characterized by matt black PVC door window frames, fittings trim with imitation leather in wood grain, trunk liner, fog lights (fog lights and -schlusslicht ) two-tone horn, stick shift / steering wheel circuit, heated rear window and a Malimo corduroy interior. In addition, all models which until then had chromed body parts were black plastic powder coated. This is a sign of shortage of raw materials the East German economy and as an attempt to keep up with the prevailing taste step. From VIN 20:24 100 the hitherto all predecessors (including the DKW) built behind the radiator has been moved forward in the produced since June 30, 1985 vehicles. Therefore, the body was given a new front midsection without a separate "Grill" with revised headlights. Competition[edit] The 353 was campaigned extensively, mostly as a rally car. For instance, a 353 driven by Niebergall and Froman finished tenth overall in the 1976 Acropolis Rally.[2] Its best world championshop rallying result was a second place in the 1973 Polish Rally, three hours behind the winner. Only one more car reached the finish. The 353's last World Rally Championship result was at the 1993 1000 Lakes Rally, where Alpo Saastamoinen finished 53rd overall and fifth in class (A/5).[3] Model range[edit]  Sedan, four-door Kombi, four-door ("Tourist") (Estate/Station wagon) Pickup, two-door ("Trans") (coupe utility) Prototypes / Special vehicles      Wartburg 355 Koupe      Wartburg 355 Wartburg with gas turbines -drive Wartburg Rallye Trans (Quantity: 3 (2 × original / 1 × replica)) Wartburg 353 Rally Duo, prototype with two engines (quantity: 1) Wartburg 353 WR, rally car according to the rules of the group B Wartburg 353 W460, rally car CMEA car 610 M Wartburg 360 (similar to the Audi 80 in appearance) Wartburg 400 (bucket Wartburg for NVA ) Wartburg 760 (nicknamed the "pot-bellied pig", this was a projected collaboration with Škoda meant to replace the 353 as well as the Trabant and the Škoda 100)    Special Editions[edit] Ambulance[edit]     Wartburg 353W Tourist-based ambulance   MED-ambulance emergency vehicle of the Red Cross of the GDR in the field of rapid medical aid (SMH), the urgent medical aid (DMH) and the urgent house call service (DHD) with a total of 100 vehicles, of which four are in the service of the National People's Army (NVA)  Melkus[edit] Melkus RS1000 a sports car from Melkus developed from the Wartburg 353.
