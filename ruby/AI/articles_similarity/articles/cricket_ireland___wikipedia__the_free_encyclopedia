The Union also organises the premier club cricket competition in Ireland, the Irish Senior Cup.

Flag of the Irish team   In common with a number of other Ireland sporting governing bodies, the Union represents all of Ireland, rather than just the Republic of Ireland. In common with its counterparts for rugby union and field hockey, the Union therefore does not use the Irish tricolor, but instead employs its own flag.[4][5] Ireland is one of the teams in Division 1 of Associate Members of International Cricket Council who has One Day International and T20 International status. Ireland's greatest cricketing success to date is 3 wicket victory over England in 2011 Cricket World Cup in which Kevin O'Brien scored the World Cup's fastest century [6] and Ireland set a World Cup record with by "chasing" 327 runs. During 2007 World Cup Ireland had major success with their victory by three wickets over Pakistan in a 2007 Cricket World Cup group match.[7] This was overshadowed by the sudden death of the Pakistan Coach Bob Woolmer. Ireland also managed to beat the West Indies in their prime in 1968 and put in a good performance against Bangladesh and won in the world cup.[citation needed] The Irish Cricket Union was dissolved and reformed as a limited company on 3 February 2008 at its annual general meeting.[8] After the tremendous success at International stage, Cricket Ireland has applied for Full Membership from the International Cricket Council. Ireland have recently won the ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier 2008 and 2009 ICC World Cup Qualifier and qualified for 2009 World Twenty20 and 2011 Cricket World Cup. Being a full member will allow Ireland to be a permanent One Day International and eventually granting them Test status.[9] On August 2011, Cricket Ireland announced its plans to put in place a first-class structure, which is a major achievement for the nation on their path to gaining Test status.[10] In 2012, Cricket Ireland announced that it had found the pathway to Test status for their tremendously successful men's team by 2020. Targets include an increase in the number of people playing the game in Ireland to 50,000, reaching eighth in the world rankings and establishing a domestic first-class structure. A number of commercial deals have been secured, allowing Ireland to unveil their strategic plan to 2015 and target their ultimate ambition of securing Test status. Cricket Ireland has offered a record 23 professional contracts to players, in three categories, for 2012, a development Simmons says is vital for their continued improvement. Phil Simmons, the Ireland coach, has also agreed a two-year extension to his contract which will take him through to at least the end of Ireland's World Cup qualifying campaign late next year. Initiatives to swell participation numbers to 50,000 will include the establishment of regional academies; a Get Into Cricket scheme which will seek to attract six to 12-year-olds to take up the game in clubs and schools; a Better Clubs Initiative, which will encourage clubs to improve their facilities; and the Cricket Ireland national awards which will recognise contributions ranging from players to volunteers. "Our commitment to the game at grassroots level will hopefully make a real difference on the ground," Warren Deutrom, Cricket Ireland CEO, said. "We want to give as much attention to the domestic game as we have to the international teams in the last four years."[11] In another sign of the growing popularity of cricket in Ireland, the Irish provided a record 23 national contracts for the 2012 season, which also included not only the senior and regular members of the squad, but also fringe players. The contracts, for the first time, were divided into sections: Category A, Category B, and Category C (for fringe players).[12] Objectives[edit] Vision to 2020 - Ireland a Test nation  To gain Test and full member status by 2020 To set out a series of stretching goals including increasing the number of participants in the game to 50,000 Reaching 8th in the world ODI rankings by 2015 Establishing a domestic first-class structure Reinforcing cricket as the 4th-most major sport in Ireland[12]  Grass Roots Initiatives[edit] Reflecting the rising popularity of the game in Ireland, Cricket Ireland committed to developing the grass roots of the sport over the next four years. New plans were unveiled to provide a significant boost to the domestic game with a series of initiatives designed to strengthen the game on the island and help achieve the ambitious target of 50,000 participants by 2015. The initiatives include:-  The ‘Get into Cricket Scheme ‘ a major new programme targeting schools and clubs encouraging 6- to 12-year-olds to take up the game for the first time   The National Cup – a new domestic National club competition for clubs not already competing in the Bob Kerr Irish Senior Cup. This provides 32 new clubs with the chance to compete for an All Ireland title and the opportunity to play cricket outside of their local area   The ‘Better Clubs Initiative’ – an innovative programme supporting local clubs across the country to improve their facilities. This programme is a volunteering initiative aimed at encouraging local cricket supporters, their friend and families to undertake work to improve the facilities at their local club houses and grounds   The Cricket Ireland National Awards – a major awards event recognising players, coaches, volunteers, groundsmen, officials and clubs for the contribution they make to the game in Ireland. This will be an annual event starting in 2012   The establishment of Regional Academies to develop and foster the young talent from the ages of 15 to 19 and ensure a pipeline of players for our International teams   The re-launch of the Inter-Pro Series as a precursor to setting up a first class domestic playing infrastructure in Ireland.
