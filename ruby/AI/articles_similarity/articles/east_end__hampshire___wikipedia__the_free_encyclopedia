Its nearest town is Lymington, which lies approximately 4.2 miles (6.7 km) south-west from the hamlet. History[edit] Although traditionally within the parish of Boldre, the name of the hamlet apparently derives from the fact that "East End Bridge" was also the easternmost point of the parliamentary borough of Lymington.[1] The bridge in question is built over Crockford Stream which flows into Sowley Pond just to the southeast of East End. An Independent Chapel was built at East End in 1808, later to become Congregational and, subsequently, a United Reformed Church. The small brick building with its tiled roof survives as a commercial establishment.[2] The hamlet of East End was included in the civil parish of East Boldre when the parish was created in 1929.[3] There is one inn called the "East End Arms". It was bought in the mid 1990s by John Illsley, former bass guitarist of the rock band, Dire Straits.[4][5] Notes[edit]   ^ John Gorton, (1833), A topographical dictionary of Great Britain and Ireland, page 30 ^ East Boldre: A New Forest Squatters Settlement 1700 - 1900 ^ East Boldre, www3.hants.gov.uk ^ East End Arms - New Forest Pub ^ The East End Arms, Hampshire: Hotel Guru, Daily Telegraph, 10 September 2011   External links[edit]  Media related to East End, Hampshire at Wikimedia Commons         v t e   Towns, villages and hamlets in the New Forest District of Hampshire, England             Allum Green Ashlett Ashley Ashurst Bank Bartley Barton on Sea Bashley Battramsley Beaulieu Beckley Bickton Bisterne Blackfield Blashford Blissford Bolderwood Boldre Bramshaw Bransgore Breamore Brockenhurst Brook Brookheath Bucklers Hard Burgate Burley Bull Hill Cadnam Calshot Colbury Copythorne Crow Damerham Denny Lodge Dibden Dibden Purlieu Downton East Boldre East End East Mills Emery Down Ellingham Everton Exbury Fawley Fordingbridge Fritham Frogham Furze Hill Godshill Gorley Lynch Hale Hangersley Harbridge Hardley Hightown Highwood Hinton Holbury Hordle Hungerford Hyde Hythe Ibsley Keyhaven Langley Lepe Linbrook Linford Linwood Lopshill Lower Daggons Lymington Lyndhurst Marchwood Martin Milford on Sea Minstead Mockbeggar Netley Marsh New Milton Norley Wood North Charford North Gorley Ogdens Ossemsley Ower Pennington Picket Hill Picket Post Pilley Portmore Poulner Ringwood Rockbourne Rockford Sandford Sandleheath Shobley Sopley South Baddesley South Charford South Gorley Stuckton Sway Tinkers Cross Tiptoe Totton and Eling Turmer Walhampton Whitsbury Winsor Woodgreen Woodlands Wootton             This Hampshire location article is a stub.
