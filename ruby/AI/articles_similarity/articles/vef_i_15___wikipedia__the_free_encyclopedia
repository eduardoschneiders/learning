Two examples of the I-15, a small, single-engined monoplane were built by the VEF to the designs of Kārlis Irbītis and were used by the Latvian Air Force    Contents   1 Development and design 2 Specifications (I-15b) 3 Notes 4 References 5 External links    Development and design[edit] In 1938, the Latvian aircraft designer Kārlis Irbītis, working at the Valsts Elektrotehniskā Fabrika (VEF) at Riga commenced design of a single-seat advanced trainer as a follow on to his earlier, similar VEF I-14 aircraft. The I-15 was a low-winged monoplane of all-wooden construction, powered by a single de Havilland Gipsy Six air-cooled engine, and fitted with a fixed tailwheel undercarriage.[1] In April 1939,[2] the first prototype, the I-15a, powered by a 200 hp (149 kW) Gypsy Six I driving a two-bladed fixed-pitch wooden propeller, made its maiden flight, while a second prototype, the I-15b, was powered by a 220 hp (167 kW) Gypsy Six II engine driving a variable-pitch propeller, and armed with a single synchronised machine gun followed, this demonstrating improved performance.[1] The two I-15 prototypes were transferred to the Latvian Air Force for use as advanced trainers,[1] while a further two aircraft, to be designated I-15bis and powered by Hispano-Suiza 6 Mb engines were ordered by the Air Force, but on 17 June 1940, the Soviet Union occupied Latvia, ordering all aviation related work to be stopped.[3]  Specifications (I-15b)[edit] Data from Air International, January 1979 [1] General characteristics  Crew: 1 Length: 7.10 m (23 ft 4 in) Wingspan: 8.00 m (26 ft 3 in) Height: 2.10 m (6 ft 11 in) [4] Wing area: 10.77 m2 (115.9 sq ft) Empty weight: 750 kg (1,653 lb) Gross weight: 960 kg (2,116 lb) Powerplant: 1 × de Havilland Gipsy Six Series II six-cylinder inverted air-cooled inline engine, 160 kW (220 hp)  Performance  Maximum speed: 331 km/h (206 mph; 179 kn) Cruising speed: 300 km/h (186 mph; 162 kn) (max continuous cruise) Range: 610 km (379 mi; 329 nmi) Service ceiling: 7,000 m (22,966 ft)  Armament  Guns: 1× machine gun  Notes[edit]   ^ a b c d Air International January 1979, pp. 45–46 ^ Vercamer,Arvo.
