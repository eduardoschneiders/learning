Professional[edit] Real Salt Lake drafted Nolly in the second round of the 2005 MLS SuperDraft, and he saw limited action with the team in his rookie season. After the 2006 season, he was dealt to D.C. United in a deal that involved Freddy Adu and Nick Rimando. He had trials at Celtic FC of Scotland and Dinamo Bucharest of Romania, but eventually signed with United in February 2007.[1] He was later waived by D.C. United in January 2008 to make room for incoming transfers from South America. He signed with the Vancouver Whitecaps on January 23, 2008. On October 12, 2008 he helped the Whitecaps capture their second USL First Division Championship beating the Puerto Rico Islanders 2-1 in Vancouver[2] On December 16, 2008 the Vancouver Whitecaps announced the re-signing of Nolly for the 2009 season.[3] On December 5, 2011, Chicago Fire announced they acquired Nolly in exchange for their first round selection in the 2013 MLS Supplemental Draft.[4] After the conclusion of the 2012 season, Chicago declined the 2013 option on Nolly's contract and he entered the 2012 MLS Re-Entry Draft.
