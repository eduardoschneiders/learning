(August 2009) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)     Dunkeld Cathedral      History   Authorising papal bull N/A   Associated people Crínán of Dunkeld   Administration   Diocese Diocese of Dunkeld   Clergy   Bishop(s) John the Scot, Robert de Cardeny, Gavin Douglas, Robert Crichton   Dunkeld Cathedral stands on the north bank of the River Tay in Dunkeld, Perth and Kinross, Scotland. Built in square-stone style of predominantly grey sandstone, the cathedral proper was begun in 1260 and completed in 1501. It stands on the site of the former Culdee Monastery of Dunkeld, stones from which can be seen as an irregular reddish streak in the eastern gable.

Gothic and Norman elements are intermingled throughout the structure. Although partly in ruins, the cathedral is in regular use today and is open to the public. Relics of Saint Columba, including his bones, were said to have been kept at Dunkeld until the Reformation, at which time they were removed to Ireland. Some believe there are still undiscovered Columban relics buried within the cathedral grounds. The original monastery at Dunkeld dated from the sixth or early seventh century, founded after an expedition of Saint Columba to the Land of Alba. It was at first a simple collection of wattle huts. During the ninth century Causantín mac Fergusa constructed a more substantial monastery of reddish sandstone and declared Dunkeld the Primacy (centre) of the faith in Alba. For reasons not completely understood, the Celtic bell believed to have been used at the monastery is not preserved in the cathedral. Instead, it was used in the Little Dunkeld Church, the parish church of the district of Minor or Lesser Dunkeld. Possibly this was because the later Augustinian canons regarded Culdeeism as heresy, and refused relics or saints of that faith. In the 11th century, the Celtic Abbacy of Dunkeld became an appanage of the Crown and subsequently descended to the Earls of Fife. Dunkeld Cathedral is today a Crown property, through Historic Scotland. In 1689 the Battle of Dunkeld was fought around the cathedral between the Jacobite Highlanders loyal to James II and VII and a government force supporting William of Orange, with the latter winning the day. Parish[edit] Dunkeld Cathedral is still used as the town's Church of Scotland parish church, with services every Sunday (although the congregation uses the smaller "Little Dunkeld" Church during winter months.) The current minister (since 2001) is the Reverend R. Fraser Penny. The small Chapter House Museum offers a collection of relics from monastic and medieval times, and local history exhibits. Burials[edit]     The Tomb of Alexander Stewart   Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan, known as "the Wolf of Badenoch", was buried in the cathedral following his death in 1405, where his tomb, surmounted by his armoured effigy, can still be seen. Other noteworthy burials include:  John Scotus (bishop of Dunkeld), (1183–1203) Geoffrey de Liberatione, Bishop of Dunkeld (1236/7–1249) Richard de Inverkeithing, a chamberlain of King Alexander II of Scotland and Bishop of Dunkeld (1250/2–1272) William Sinclair (bishop), Bishop of Dunkeld (1309–1337) Michael de Monymusk, Bishop of Dunkeld (1370–1376) John Stewart, 1st Earl of Atholl, (c. 1440–1512) Robert Cockburn, Bishop of Dunkeld (1524–1526) Charles Edward Stuart, Count Roehenstart (1784–1854)  Gallery[edit]        The Tower of Dunkeld Cathedral          The cathedral's interior seen from the altar          The cathedral's interior looking towards the altar          The ruins of the nave          Nave interior          Arches in the nave          View from the tower          East window     See also[edit]  Crínán of Dunkeld Bishop of Dunkeld List of Church of Scotland parishes The Hermitage (Scotland) List of cathedrals in Scotland  External links[edit]  Dunkeld Cathedral 1894 Floor Plan Engraving of Dunkeld Cathedral in 1693 by John Slezer at National Library of Scotland  Coordinates: 56°33′54″N 3°35′23″W﻿ / ﻿56.56500°N 3.58972°W﻿ / 56.56500; -3.58972         v t e   "Cathedrals" of the Church of Scotland          St Machar, Aberdeen Holy Trinity, Brechin St Mary, Dornoch St Blane, Dunblane St Columba, Dunkeld St Giles, Edinburgh St Mungo, Glasgow St Magnus, Kirkwall St Moluag, Lismore                            Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dunkeld_Cathedral&oldid=716827804"          Categories: Churches completed in 1501Cathedrals of the Church of ScotlandCategory A listed buildings in Perth and KinrossListed cathedrals in ScotlandScheduled Ancient Monuments in ScotlandMedieval cathedrals in ScotlandChurches in Perth and KinrossHistoric Scotland propertiesVisitor attractions in Perth and KinrossMuseums in Perth and KinrossReligious museums in ScotlandLocal museums in ScotlandRenaissance architecture in ScotlandCuldeesCemeteries in Scotland1501 establishments in ScotlandHidden categories: Articles lacking sources from August 2009All articles lacking sourcesPages using infobox church with unknown parametersCoordinates on Wikidata
