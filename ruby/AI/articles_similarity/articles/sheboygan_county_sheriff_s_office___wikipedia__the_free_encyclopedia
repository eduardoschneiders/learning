Today's boundaries of the county are still those established in 1838. The Sheboygan County Sheriff's Office was established in 1846 and T.C. Horner was the first Sheriff elected. The Sheriff's Office was once located inside the David Taylor House,[1] which still stands today in the same location as a part of the Sheboygan County Historical Museum. The jail was located in the basement of the David Taylor House from 1915 to 1936 while the Sheriff's Office was located on the first floor and the Sheriff's residence on the second floor. In 1936, the Sheriff's Office and county jail moved to the top floor of the Sheboygan County Courthouse. In 1981, the Sheboygan County Sheriff's Office relocated to its present location inside the Law Enforcement Center at 525 North 6th Street in Sheboygan. At the time, it was a very contemporary linear facility with modern security systems. The second floor of the Sheriff's Office served as the county jail until 1998 when a 95,000 square foot, 295 bed Detention Center was constructed on the city's south side. It was envisioned the Sheriff's Office and the Sheboygan Police Department would be housed inside the Law Enforcement Center but that never occurred. In 2012, after years of discussion, the Sheboygan County and City of Sheboygan approved an agreement to combine emergency dispatch at the Law Enforcement Center.[2] Under the proposal, the city will fund remodeling of the new center by providing $2.5 million for the project.[3] The Joint Dispatch Center is scheduled to be in operation in 2016.

The Corrections Division operates the Sheboygan County Detention Center, located at 2923 South 31st Street and the Sheboygan County Juvenile Detention Center, located at 525 North 6th Street in Sheboygan. The dvision is made up of 54 correctional officers, 12 supervisors, one Huber Corporal and the Corrections Administrator.
