The school's senior school basketball team ranked 1st in South Central zones. The junior team came second in the ISAA league. Their 8/9 Girls' volleyball team has won South Central Zones. The school's coaches are extremely committed to the game. For Physical Education, students are not only graded on their athletic ability, but on their good sportsmanship as well. There are also fitness tests including the beep test, sit ups, stretches and push ups. Musicals[edit] The school has an annual musical. All junior and senior high students are permitted to audition for the show which changes from year to year. In 2010, they started the musical program with Seussical Jr. In 2011 they performed Hairspray. In March 2012 they performed Beauty and the Beast, Fame in 2013, and Legally Blonde: The Musical in 2014. The musicals are always produced with a full set of lights and mics and for all the shows except Seussical, a live orchestra made of a mixture of students and professional musicians conducted by the school's artist in residence. Debate[edit] The art of debate is an important part of our school culture. Our debate club competes in numerous English and French events throughout the school year. In past years, CFIS students have qualified for both Provincial and National Debate Tournaments. The idea behind debate is that there are two sides to every issue - the Affirmative and the Negative. The two sides of the debate have different jobs arising from their position with respect to the Resolution, issue or topic. Participants of the Debate Club benefit from developing public speaking, critical thinking, research and teamwork skills. We deal with the challenge of learning to be resourceful thinkers who can synthesize ideas and quickly articulate them. Clubs and options[edit] There are many elementary clubs and Junior-High clubs. Clubs mostly take place during lunch/recess periods and are optional. There are Improv clubs, Debate clubs, Yearbook club, Student Council, Science Olympics, Environment Club, Jazz Club, and others. The school follows a six-day cycle. For students in Junior High, there is an options class 2 out of the 6 days during which students participate in Robotics, Photography, Weight Training, Visual Art, Drama, Outdoor Education, Sewing or Food Studies. During 3 of the remaining 6 days, there is a choice between band, Film Studies or Learning Skills (there are only 5 of the six days with option classes) . Students will select a different option for every quarter ( 4 in every school year) Travel Studies[edit] Opportunities for national and international travel are offered in Junior/Senior High. These trips involve preparation / study beforehand and tie in with the appropriate curriculum. Every year, students go on trips in and around the city of Calgary, some of which include a ski day at Lake Louise or Sunshine Village. As well, students have optional cultural voyages to various destinations including grade 7 trips to Québec, Ottawa, and Montreal. For Grade 8, there is a Week-Without-Walls. In Grade 9, there is an optional trip to Costa Rica. For Senior High, the travel studies program changes each year. In 2011, the Senior High students went to Columbia, in 2012 they traveled to Ecuador and the Galapagos Islands The Travel Studies program permits students to experience first-hand other cultures and learn about ecology, geography, history and social studies as well. It is also a great opportunity to bond with friends, as students normally share their accommodations with a few friends. The students in Senior High will be going to Cambodia for the 2013 trip. At school programs[edit] Spanish and French language programs are offered for adults in the evenings at the school. The Annual CFIS Fundraising Gala is the largest fundraising event for CFIS. Since 2001, Gala guests, donors and sponsors have helped raise almost $500,000 for CFIS programs and equipment. There are local and international awareness campaigns like the Thumbs-Up! anti-distracted driving campaign, Project Haiti (donation of clothing & school supplies), participation in Operation: Christmas Child, food bank donations, Jacket Racket, 24-hour Famine, and Shave-Your-Lid-for-a-Kid (which supports Kids Kancer Kare).
