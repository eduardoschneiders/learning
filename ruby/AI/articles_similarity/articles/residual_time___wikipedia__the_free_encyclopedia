The residual time is very important in most of the practical applications of renewal processes:  In queueing theory, it determines the remaining time, that a newly arriving customer to a non-empty queue has to wait until being served.[1] In wireless networking, it determines, for example, the remaining lifetime of a wireless link on arrival of a new packet. In dependability studies, it models the remaining lifetime of a component. etc.     Contents   1 Formal definition 2 Probability distribution of the residual time  2.1 Special case: Markovian holding times   3 Related notions 4 References    Formal definition[edit]     Sample evolution of a renewal process with holding times Si and jump times Jn.

Intuitively, this means that it does not matter how long it has been since the last renewal epoch, the remaining time is still probabilistically the same as in the beginning of the holding time interval. Related notions[edit] Renewal theory texts usually also define the spent time or the backward recurrence time (or the current lifetime) as                         Z         (         t         )         =         t         −                    J                        N             (             t             )                                     {\displaystyle Z(t)=t-J_{N(t)}}    . Its distribution can be calculated in a similar way to that of the residual time. However, the spent time has much less practical interest than the residual time. References[edit]   ^ William J.
