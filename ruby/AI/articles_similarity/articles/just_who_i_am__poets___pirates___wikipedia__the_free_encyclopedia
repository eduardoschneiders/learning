Reception[edit] Commercial Performance[edit] The album debuted at number 3 on the Billboard 200 chart. In its first week, the album had the best weekly sales of any country album since the Dixie Chicks' Taking the Long Way in May 2006[11] and the album has sold 1.4 million copies in the U.S. up to August 2008.[12] Critical Response[edit] The album represented a move by Chesney to a more gulf and western sound with a number of "breezy, steel-drum island songs."[2] Track listing[edit]   No. Title Writer(s) Length   1.
