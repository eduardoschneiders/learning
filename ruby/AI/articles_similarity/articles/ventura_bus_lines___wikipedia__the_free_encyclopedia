The first depot was behind the petrol station on the corner of Station Street and Canterbury Road, in Box Hill South. The business was named after Ventura County, California where Cornwall had spent time after serving in World War I.[1] Expansion[edit]     Ventura V/line Volvo B13R Volgren "C222TX" at Koo-Wee-Rup in April 2016.   In 1943 the Aspendale - Mordialloc service was acquired. In the late 1940s this was extended from Mordialloc to Mentone and in 1951 from Aspendale to Chelsea. Following the opening of Chadstone Shopping Centre in 1960 services from Burwood and South Oakleigh were added.[1] In the 1950s and 1960s a number of operations were purchased:[1][3]  Knibbs Bus Service with routes 225A Box Hill - Ferntree Gully and 226A Box Hill - Burwood in June 1954 Box Hill Bus Lines with the Box Hill - Forest Hill service in February 1957 Clarinda Transport with the Oakleigh - Glen Waverley service in May 1958 High Street Road Bus Service from Reg Carter with the Glen Waverley - Glen Iris service in April 1968  In 1957 a new depot was opened on the corner of Centre and Warrigal Roads, Oakleigh. This was followed in the mid 1960s by a depot on Mahoneys Road, East Burwood to replace the original Box Hill depot. In 1969 the Mitcham routes of C Young were purchased followed in September 1970 by Boronia Bus Lines from Don Nugent with 12 routes.[1] In April 1987 Ventura acquired Bentleigh Bus Lines with three routes, and in December 1987 Hawthorn Bus Services, Rennies Bus Services, and Willis Bus Services all from Vic Haoust.[3][4] As a result of these purchases, it built a new depot at Knoxfield to replace East Burwood. Further growth[edit]     DesignLine-bodied MAN 16.240 in SmartBus livery in August 2009   In 2000 Ventura introduced the first Australian buses to run on ethanol fuel.[5][6] In February 2000 Ventura purchased Mount Dandenong Passenger Service from the Frazer family.[7] In 2004 it purchased National Bus Company from the National Express Group becoming the largest private bus operator in Melbourne.[8][9] On 5 August 2002, the State Government introduced the first SmartBus service (as a trial project) run by Ventura that replaced the old timetable of the 703 Middle Brighton station – Blackburn station with a new, high frequency service on route 703. Due to the success of the initial SmartBus trial (patronage increased by up to 25%), the State Government introduced another service that Ventura operated, the former route 700 from Box Hill station to Mordialloc station via Warrigal Road. This was upgraded in April 2009 to the Red Orbital 903 service from Altona station to Mordialloc station via Sunshine, Essendon, Preston, Heidelberg, Doncaster, Chadstone and Warrigal Road. In December 2009 Ventura purchased US Bus Lines from the Pulitano Group, operating route services in the outer east region. In July 2010, Ventura acquired Ivanhoe Bus Company, operating in the north and north east region. In January 2012 Ventura purchased Grenda Transit from Grenda Corporation.[10][11] As part of the financing of the deal a 15% stake in Ventura was sold to the Intermediate Capital Group.[12] In August 2013, as the result of the re-tendering of a number of Melbourne bus routes, the operation of SmartBus Route 903, and the Doncaster & North Fitzroy depots, were transferred to Transdev Melbourne, along with 346 buses.[13] Ventura has grown from a one-man, one vehicle operator to a significant business with over 1,600 employees. Fleet[edit]     Northcoast Bus & Coach bodied Scania L94UB at Chadstone Shopping Centre in April 2008       Ventura bus Volgren "CR228L" PTV livery, at Upper Ferntree Gully station in October 2015.   From the 1940s, Ventura standardised on Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation bodied Bedford OBs. After purchasing a variety of AECs, Albions, Bedfords and Leylands in the 1960s, Ventura settled on heavy duty Leyland Worldmaster, Leopard and Tiger chassis for its purchases in the 1970s and 1980s.[1] In 1973 Ventura took delivery of the first of many Denning coaches. It would build up a sizeable fleet before scaling back its charter operations in the early 1990s.[1] The purchases of Bentleigh Bus Lines/Hawthorn Bus Service saw the fleet expand further. Many non-Leyland buses joined the fleet including Bedfords, Elwoods, Mercedes-Benzs and Volvo B10Ms. When Ventura sought new buses in 1992 Leyland had ceased production, so two Scania L113s and a Volvo B10M with Volgren bodies were purchased for evaluation.[14] Ventura settled on Scanias after the evaluation period and have since been the main chassis used in the Ventura fleet with 293 in the fleet as at May 2013.[3] It has also purchased 107 DesignLine bodied MANs. Since 2013 the fleet has switched to Volvo B7RLE's with Volgren bodywork. As of 2015, new deliveries have reverted to Scania, with their K310UB chassis with Volgren Optimus bodywork. As at January 2014 the fleet excluding the Grenda Corporation fleets stood at 308.[3] Fleet livery had long been light and dark blue with yellow signwriting. This was replaced in 2012 by a white with dark blue and yellow flashes livery. New deliveries are receiving the PTV standard white/orange Victorian route bus livery with existing buses being progressively repainted. Buses which will be replaced in the short term will retain the two-tone blue livery and a plain white livery with Ventura signage was adopted for school/charter vehicles See also[edit]  Buses in Melbourne List of Victorian Bus Companies List of Melbourne bus routes  References[edit]   ^ a b c d e f g "The Ventura Story - 75 Years of Moving People" Australian Bus Panorama December 1999 page 19 ^ "Stats and facts about Ventura" (PDF).
