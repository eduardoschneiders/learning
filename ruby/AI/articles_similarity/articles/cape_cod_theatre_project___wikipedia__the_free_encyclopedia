          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                            Jump to:     navigation,      search          The Cape Cod Theatre Project is a nonprofit organization founded in 1995 by actors Andrew Polk and Jim Bracchitta, with the mission of collaborating with playwrights, actors, directors, and the public in developing new American plays. The performances are staged readings, after which the audience members may share their reactions with the playwright and help him/her revise the script. Performances are staged at Falmouth Academy, in Falmouth, Massachusetts. The Cape Cod Theatre Project also offers an internship program in which young people are able to learn about stage production and theatrical techniques.
