The status is purely honorary, and does not give any additional powers to the council or inhabitants of the district. In Scotland, similarly chartered communities were known as royal burghs, although the status is no longer granted.

The corporations had been reformed by legislation beginning in 1835 (1840 in Ireland). By the time of their abolition there were three types:  County boroughs Municipal or non-county boroughs Rural boroughs  Many of the older boroughs could trace their origin to medieval charters or were boroughs by prescription, with Saxon origins. Most of the boroughs created after 1835 were new industrial, resort or suburban towns that had grown up after the industrial revolution. Borough corporations could also have the status of a city. For pre-1974 boroughs, see Municipal Corporations Act 1835, Boroughs incorporated in England and Wales 1835–1882, Unreformed boroughs in England and Wales 1835–1886, Boroughs incorporated in England and Wales 1882–1974, Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840 Modern borough status[edit] England and Wales[edit] Borough status no longer implies a town or urban area. Outside Greater London, borough status is granted to metropolitan and non-metropolitan districts under the provisions of section 245 of the Local Government Act 1972. This section allows the council of a district to petition the monarch for a charter granting borough status. The resolution must have the support of at least two-thirds of the councillors. Having received the petition the monarch may, on the advice of the Privy Council, grant a charter whereupon:  The district becomes a borough The district council becomes the borough council The chairman and vice-chairman become entitled to the style mayor and deputy mayor of the borough, except in councils that have an elected mayor under the Local Government Act 2000.  Charters granted under the 1972 Act may allow the borough council to appoint "local officers of dignity" previously appointed by an abolished borough corporation. Examples include:  Honorary Recorder: some borough and city councils have the right to appoint a circuit judge or recorder appointed under the Courts Act 1971 as honorary recorder. Usually this is the senior judge in the council's area. Sheriff: These are appointed in a number of boroughs and cities that were formerly counties corporate. High Steward: originally a judicial office, often held by a peer, now entirely ceremonial.  There is no obligation on the council to appoint persons to these positions. In some boroughs the mayor has the additional title as "Admiral of the Port", recalling an historic jurisdiction. The Lord Mayors of Chester and Kingston-upon-Hull are Admirals of the Dee and the Humber respectively, the Mayor of Medway is Admiral of the River Medway, and the Mayors of Poole and Southampton are Admirals of those ports.[1][2][3][4][5] Privileges or rights belonging to citizens or burgesses of a former borough can be transferred to the inhabitants of the new borough. Borough councils are permitted to pass a resolution admitting "persons of distinction" and persons who have "rendered eminent service" to be an honorary freeman of the borough. This power has been used to grant freedom not only to individuals, but to units and ships of the armed forces.

The 1994 Act amended section 245 of the Local Government Act 1972, allowing for the new unitary county councils established by the Act to apply for a charter in a similar manner to the old district councils. On receiving a charter a county became a "county borough". Welsh unitary authorities granted a charter in 1996 bestowing county borough status   County borough Previous boroughs Notes   Aberconwy and Colwyn Aberconwy, Colwyn Renamed Conwy 1996   Blaenau Gwent Blaenau Gwent    Bridgend Ogwr    Caerphilly Islwyn    Cardiff Cardiff has the status of a "city and county" by letters patent   Conwy See Aberconwy and Colwyn   Merthyr Tydfil Merthyr Tydfil    Neath and Port Talbot Neath, Port Talbot Renamed Neath Port Talbot 1996   Newport Newport Became "city and county" in 2002   Rhondda Cynon Taff Cynon Valley, Rhondda, Taff-Ely    Swansea Swansea has the status of a "city and county" by letters patent   Torfaen Torfaen    Vale of Glamorgan Vale of Glamorgan    Wrexham Wrexham Maelor    Northern Ireland[edit] The privileges of borough status are that the council chairperson is called "mayor" and up to one quarter of councillors can be called "alderman", and the council can award freedom of the borough.[36][37] The Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840 extinguished all the boroughs in Ireland except for ten, of which two were in what would become Northern Ireland in 1921: Belfast (made a city in 1888) and Derry (officially Londonderry, and a city since 1604). Several of the urban districts in Northern Ireland created under the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898 later received charters granting borough status. The Local Government Act (Northern Ireland) 1972 replaced the multi-tier local government system with 26 unitary districts whose councils could retain the charter of a borough within the district; other districts later received borough charters in their own right. The 2015 local government reforms replaced the 26 districts with 11 larger districts. The "statutory transition committee" handling each council merger had the right to request transfer of borough status as in 1972,[38][39][40] and unionist-majority councils did so, while nationalist-majority councils chose not to apply.[41] There were complications where places had city status;[42][43] therefore Belfast, Derry and Lisburn's borough charters carried over automatically, without the need for the council to pass a resolution.[44] Although Newry received city status in 2002, Newry and Mourne District Council did not receive borough status. In 2015 its successor Newry, Mourne and Down District Council voted not to request borough status, the required two-thirds majority failing after opposition from Sinn Féin.[45]  Northern Ireland boroughs since 1840  2015 borough 1972–2015 borough pre-1972 borough Year of charter Notes   Antrim and Newtownabbey[46] Antrim  1977 Antrim town's borough status was extinguished in 1840. It was Antrim's borough charter which the merged council opted to preserve in 2015.[46]   Antrim and Newtownabbey Newtownabbey  1977    Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon[47] Armagh  1997[48] Armagh town already had city status granted by letters patent in 1994. Its previous borough status was extinguished in 1840. It was Armagh's borough charter which the merged council opted to preserve in 2015.[47]   Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Craigavon Portadown, Lurgan 1947,[49] 1949    Belfast[44] Belfast Belfast 1613[50] Charter reformed 1840. City status by letters patent of 1888.   Causeway Coast and Glens[51] Ballymoney  1977    Causeway Coast and Glens Coleraine Coleraine 1928 Coleraine's previous borough status was extinguished in 1840. It was Coleraine's borough charter which the merged council opted to preserve in 2015.[51]   Causeway Coast and Glens Limavady  1989    Derry and Strabane[44] Derry Londonderry 1604[52] Charter reformed 1840. District and borough renamed Derry 1984; name of city remains Londonderry (see Derry/Londonderry name dispute).[53]   Lisburn and Castlereagh[44] Castlereagh  1977 The new district council is called Lisburn and Castlereagh City Council.[54]   Lisburn and Castlereagh Lisburn Lisburn 1964. Lisburn was granted city status by letters patent in 2002.   Mid and East Antrim[55] Ballymena Ballymena 1937    Mid and East Antrim Carrickfergus Carrickfergus 1939 Carrickfergus's previous borough status was extinguished in 1840. It was Carrickfergus's borough charter which the merged council opted to preserve in 2015.[55]   Mid and East Antrim Larne Larne 1938    Ards and North Down Ards Newtownards 1927 Newtownards' previous borough status was extinguished in 1840. The "North Down and Ards" statutory transition committee voted in 2014 to apply for borough status for the merged district council under the name "East Coast Borough Council",[56] but negative public reaction prompted a rethink,[57] and the name "Ards and North Down" was not finalised until 2016.[58] The charter transfer was delayed until after this.[59]   Ards and North Down North Down Bangor 1927 Bangor's previous borough status was extinguished in 1840. It was North Down's borough charter which the merged council opted to preserve in 2016.[59]    Dungannon and South Tyrone  1999 Borough status was simultaneous with 1999 renaming the district from "Dungannon".[60][61] Dungannon town's borough status was extinguished in 1840. Now in Mid-Ulster District.     Enniskillen 1949[62] Previous borough status was extinguished in 1840. In 1967, Enniskillen Borough Council lost its administrative functions to Fermanagh County Council, but retained its ceremonial role.[63] The post-1972 Fermanagh District Council did not inherit Enniskillen's borough status. Since 2015 in Fermanagh and Omagh District.
