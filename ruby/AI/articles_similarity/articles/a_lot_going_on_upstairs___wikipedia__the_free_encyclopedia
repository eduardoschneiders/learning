It aired on Fox in the United States on March 6, 2016, and is written by Steve Callaghan and directed by Joe Vaux. [1] Plot[edit] Stewie begins having nightmares (consisting of where he is naked in school, a dinner with an evil Glenn Close and her associates, and how he messed up during the show's intro), and in every dream there is a dark black monster with green eyes. He decides to sleep in his parents' bedroom. Meanwhile, Stewie sleeping in his room causes Peter discomfort, and he struggles to find a sleeping spot. Brian suggests that he sleep in the attic. When Peter does, he turns it into a hangout joint. Stewie tries to evade his nightmares by refusing to sleep again. When this fails, Brian decides to help him. Brian checks on the internet that nightmares come from deep dark fears, and he and Stewie try to figure out the cause of it. Brian starts by having Chris appear as Frankenstein's monster, and a chain of Meg, Mayor Adam West, and other characters dressed as each other to try to address a possible fear of monsters. When Quagmire, Cleveland, and Joe join Peter in the attic, they begin having fun. Soon, their horseplay causes damage when they play lawn darts in the attic. Lois demands they leave the attic, which Peter doesn't want to do. Lois retaliates by locking them in with a nail gun in defiance. When every other attempt fails, Stewie invents a machine to send Brian into his subconscious to defeat the monster. Brian finds the idea insane, but agrees to it nonetheless. When Brian enters the dream, he encounters Glenn Close giving her his opinion of her performance of Cruella de Vil in the live-action version of 101 Dalmatians. Over salad, Close claims she can be silly, as opposed to all of the serious films that she usually does, and demonstrates by saying the word "fart" for Brian. Brian eventually meets Stewie, who takes him to the subconscious. After heading through a series of nightmares, they encounter the monster, and Brian uses a syringe from the nightmare Dr. Hartman to kill him, but he dissolves into Brian. Confused at first, Stewie deduces that he's afraid of disappointing Brian as he considers him a father figure, and Brian assures Stewie that he will always be happy to be proud of him. Peter, Quagmire, Cleveland, and Joe eventually go crazy. Joe even tries to shout down the ventilation, but Meg can't hear them because she is listening to a wilderness survival tape on what to do if a bear appears in front of someone. An enraged Peter orders Lois to let them go, but when she refuses to budge, they pressure her by threatening to defecate on her wedding dress. Irate, Lois takes the hand towel bar from the bathroom at the time when Meg was listening to a wilderness survival tape on how to deal with snake bites. Lois then uses it to have them escape the attic where they fall near her, but Cleveland tells her that she was too late to stop them from pooping on her dress. Either way, Peter and Lois agree that they both went a little too far. Quagmire states that he will need to take a break from his friendship with the guys for the next two weeks. Brian and Stewie then awake the next day. Brian tells Stewie what happened, but is dismissed as a weirdo. Stewie then leaves and comments that he found poop on Lois' wedding dress. Reception[edit] The episode received an audience of 2.74 million, making it the second most watched show on Fox that night behind The Simpsons.[2] References[edit]   ^ "FAMILY GUY 03/06/16 9:00pm | FOX Broadcasting Company".
