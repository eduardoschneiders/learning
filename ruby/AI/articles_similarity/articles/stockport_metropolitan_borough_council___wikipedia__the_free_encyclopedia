There are eight executive councillors, including the leader of the council; each has a separate portfolio containing responsibilities for different services and areas of the council. There are also six scrutiny committees which scrutinize decisions made by the executive. Politics[edit] Stockport Council has 63 elected members, belonging to three different parties. No party has overall control. In the council elections on Thursday 1 May 2008, in which one third of the seats were up for re-election, there were two main changes. In the Cheadle & Gatley ward, incumbent councillor Paul Carter of the Liberal Democrat party lost his seat to the Conservative candidate Mick Jones. Similarly in the Brinnington and Central Ward, Labour councillor Maureen Rowles lost her seat to the Liberal Democrat candidate Christian Walker. However, a short time after this election, he chose to serve as an Independent Councillor, then returned to the Liberal Democrats, then declared himself Independent again. During 2009, which was supposed to be a "fallow year" (one without elections), there were three by-elections following the deaths of serving councillors. Subsequently, Labour Councillor Anne Graham joined the Liberal Democrat group, bringing them to 36 Councillors of 63. On 2 February 2011, Councillors David White, Roy Driver and Anne Graham all resigned from the Liberal Democrat Group. All three cited unhappiness with the national party's involvement with a "Tory-led" government. They became Independent Left Councillors, forming the Independent Left Group on the Council, whilst awaiting the result of membership applications to the Labour Party and subsequently joined the Labour Group after the 2011 elections. Roy Driver was not selected for a seat in the May 2011 elections but may contest a seat for Labour in May 2012. On 21 January 2012, Patrick McAuley, Labour Councillor for Manor since May 2011, announced on Twitter that he had resigned from the Labour Party but that would continue to serve as a councillor; he subsequently joined the Liberal Democrat group in December 2012. In October and November 2014, Stockport Labour lost 3 seats with Brian Hendley, Paul Moss and Laura Booth all leaving the party. Hendley was deselected without his knowing, Moss resigned due to house building on Reddish Vale Country Park and Booth quit over allegations of a "culture of systematic bullying".[4] The 'All Out'[edit] In the 2004 election, all councilors on the council were put up for election at the same time. This election was conducted exclusively by postal voting. Each elector was given three votes, and asked to pick three candidates. The number of votes each candidate received then determined when they would next stand for election. Elections were then scheduled for 2007, 2008, and 2010. Non-mainstream parties[edit] Heald Green Ratepayers are the only non-mainstream candidates to win seats. References[edit]  ^ Stockport Council ^ "Your Councillors". democracy.stockport.gov.uk.
