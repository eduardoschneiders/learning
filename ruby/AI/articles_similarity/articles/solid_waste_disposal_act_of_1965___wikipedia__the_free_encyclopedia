Mainly this included open dumps and burning of trash.[4] The disposal techniques however created new environmental concerns including disease vectors [5] and air pollution.[4] Due to increasing demand for better waste management during the 1960s, the United States passed SWDA in 1965.[5] SWDA[edit] As the first Environmental Law,[5] SWDA’s main goal is to reduce waste and protect human and environmental health.[5] by decreasing pollution and promoting better municipal waste disposal technology.[4] It dictates disposal of copious amounts of both municipal and industrial waste.[5] It also defines solid waste as a local responsibility, promotes advancement of waste management technology, and declares waste management standards.[5] RRA[edit]  The Resource Recovery Act (RRA), passed in 1970, was the first amendment to the SWDA.[1] This amendment called for increased government involvement in waste management, incited reduction of waste as well as recycling technology, and introduced criteria for disposal of hazardous waste.[5]  RCRA[edit]  The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act(RCRA) was created as the first amendment to SWDA, after congress realized that the SWDA was not comprehensive enough.[5] RCRA identifies the increasing amount of both hazardous and non-hazardous being produced at the time, and declares that in order to maintain the quality of life expected in the United States, new waste management practices need to be established. It also bans open dumps  and discusses the implications of hazardous waste, recycling, and renewable energy.[6]  RCRA then goes on to dictate that assistance must be provided to communities for waste management and declare that Hazardous Waste must be properly managed, and incite a need for research into better management practices.[6] RCRA also altered the responsible party from an “end of the pipe,” meaning the waste disposal or water remediation facility, to a “cradle to grave,” meaning the party who created the waste.[5]  HSWA[edit] The Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA), passed in 1984 as an amendment to SWDA, added more stringent laws about hazardous waste management.[5] This included limiting disposal centers for hazardous waste, increasing EPA involvement, increasing waste management standards, and determining underground storage standards.[5] FFCA[edit] The final amendment to SWDA, the Federal Facilities Compliance Act (FFCA), was passed in 1992 and holds federal facilities responsible for all fines and penalties stated in SWDA and its amendments.[7] This amendment was in response to the Supreme Court ruling in DOE vs. Ohio [7] where the Supreme court ruled that the Department of Energy held sovereign immunity and therefore could not be sued for their management of a uranium processing facility.[8] Whistleblowing[edit] SWDA explicitly states that a person cannot be retaliated against because they acted as an informant to the EPA.[9] The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) defines retaliation as: loss of employment, blacklisting, demotion, denying overtime, benefits, or promotion, discipline, failure to hire or rehire, intimidation, threatening, reassignment which effects promotion prospects, reduction of pay or shifts.[10] The whistleblower clause excludes employees who violate the law without being directed to do so by the company.[9] Enforcement[edit] The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is responsible for enforcing environmental laws in the United States.[5] This includes the SWDA and all of its amendments.
