He continued umpiring in the National League until the umpiring staffs of the American and National Leagues merged in 2000. He has been a crew chief since 1999. DeMuth has worn the uniform number 32 throughout his career. His postseason assignments include 10 Division Series (1996, 1997, 1999, 2001, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013, and 2015), 5 League Championship Series (1991, 1995, 2000, 2002 and 2007), and 5 World Series (1993, 1998, 2001, 2009 and 2013). He also umpired in the All-Star Game in 1990, 2001, and 2009, working behind the plate for the second and third contests, and worked the 2009 World Baseball Classic.[1] Notable games[edit] DeMuth was the home plate umpire for Game 6 of the 1993 World Series; a game memorable for Joe Carter's series-ending home run in the bottom of the ninth inning. DeMuth was the third base umpire for the game between the San Francisco Giants and the San Diego Padres on August 4, 2007. In the top of the second inning at San Diego, Barry Bonds of the Giants hit his 755th career home run off Clay Hensley, tying Hank Aaron for first all-time.[2] DeMuth was the home plate umpire for the game between the San Francisco Giants and the New York Yankees on September 20, 2013. In the bottom of the seventh inning, Alex Rodriguez of the Yankees hit his 24th career grand slam off George Kontos, passing Lou Gehrig for first all-time. DeMuth was the second base umpire for Game 1 of the 2013 World Series and in the bottom of the first inning called Boston second baseman Dustin Pedroia out at second after thinking St. Louis shortstop Pete Kozma caught the ball and was grabbing it from his glove with his free hand, but, after a huddle, the umpires correctly ruled that the ball bounced off the tip of Kozma's glove and ruled Pedroia safe at second, loading the bases for Mike Napoli who then hit a 3-run double. DeMuth was the home plate umpire for a no-hitter pitched by Jake Arrieta between the Chicago Cubs and the Cincinnati Reds on April 21, 2016. This was Arrieta's 2nd career no hitter. Chicago won the game 16-0. See also[edit]     Biography portal    Baseball portal     List of Major League Baseball umpires  References[edit]   ^ [1] closecallsports.com.
