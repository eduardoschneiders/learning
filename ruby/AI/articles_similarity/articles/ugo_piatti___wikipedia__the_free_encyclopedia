Biography[edit] Piatti enrolled at the Brera Academy in 1903 and came into contact with the Milanese Futurists in the early years of the next decade, collaborating with Luigi Russolo on intonarumori (noise-making) machines and making his debut at the Famiglia Artistica in 1911. He accompanied Filippo Tommaso Marinetti on his trips to London, Paris and Prague after World War I. His involvement with the Novecento Italiano movement through Margherita Sarfatti in the 1920s saw a simpler handling of volume and a focus on landscape, views of Milan and still-life depictions of flowers. He exhibited work at the Venice Biennale’s 14th Esposizione Internazionale d’Arte in 1924 and in Milan at the first and second shows of the Novecento Italiano group (1926 and 1929). One of his works was bought for the Galleria d’Arte Moderna, Milan, in 1935 and a solo exhibition was held at the Galleria Pesaro in 1938.
