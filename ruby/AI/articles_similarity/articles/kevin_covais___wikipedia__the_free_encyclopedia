He is the son of John Covais, a retired sheriff, and Patty Covais. He is the youngest of three.[2] He has two siblings, a sister (Kathleen) and a brother (John). Covais was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at age eleven and receives insulin injections, like his fellow contestant, Elliott Yamin.[2][3][4] Covais started singing at the age of 10 and has taken voice lessons for four years. Covais has stated that Brian McKnight and American Idol Season 1 winner Kelly Clarkson are favorite singers of his. In the future, he plans to pursue a career in singing, acting, or journalism.[5] Covais was a junior at Island Trees High School during his Idol run;[6] he graduated at the end of the 2006-07 school year.

American Idol[edit] Covais auditioned in Boston, Massachusetts. On March 9, 2006, he made it into the top 12 of American Idol, which is the finalist round. Covais has sarcastically dubbed himself the show's "sex symbol," while fellow finalist Paris Bennett called him "Chicken Little" for his supposed resemblance to the character in the Disney movie. Following one performance, Abdul remarked that she wanted to pinch Covais' cheeks; Seacrest sent him over to where the female contestants were sitting so they could do so. Covais made it to the top 12. The week after, Covais outlasted Melissa McGhee to make it to the top 11. Covais was eliminated on March 22, 2006. He was in the bottom three with Bucky Covington and Lisa Tucker.
