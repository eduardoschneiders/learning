Following his training under master stone carvers in Italy, Arnold spent five years from 1980-1985 working on the Washington National Cathedral in D.C.,[1][2] and then established his studio in Chicago in 1985. He is fluent in styles ranging from Classical and Renaissance to Gothic, Baroque and Arts & Crafts.
