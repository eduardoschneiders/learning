It was a 12-bedded hospital on Washington Street. As the necessity to build a larger hospital became apparent, a 5.5-acre (2.2 ha) tract of land was bought by 1914, with the money raised by canvassing in the town and donation by a group of businessmen. A new, 44-bedded hospital was opened on May 18, 1917. The hospital has since expanded to 206 beds, and continues to be one of Massachusetts premiere hospitals for nursery care.
