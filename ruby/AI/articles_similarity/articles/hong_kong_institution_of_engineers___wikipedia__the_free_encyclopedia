It was founded in 1947 as the Engineering Society of Hong Kong and was incorporated as Hong Kong Institution of Engineers in 1975.[1] The institution aims to facilitate the exchange of knowledge and ideas, train the members in new technology and practices, and to raise the standing and visibility of engineers. It has a membership of more than 24,000, as of February 2010, under 19 different engineering disciplines.

The society was established in the Lee Gardens Hotel. In 1972 the Society was amalgamated with the Hong Kong Joint Group of the Institutions of Civil, Mechanical and Electrical Engineers of London, and transformed into the Hong Kong Institution of Engineers with both learned society and qualifying functions three years later.
