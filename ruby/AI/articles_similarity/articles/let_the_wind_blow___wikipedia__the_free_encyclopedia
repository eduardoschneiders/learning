"Let the Wind Blow"   Song by The Beach Boys from the album Wild Honey   Released December 18, 1967 (1967-12-18)   Recorded 1967 (1967)   Genre Rock   Length 2:19   Label Capitol   Writer    Brian Wilson Mike Love      Producer The Beach Boys      Music sample    "Let the Wind Blow"                "Let the Wind Blow" is a song written by Brian Wilson and Mike Love for American rock band the Beach Boys. It was released in 1967 as the ninth track on their thirteenth studio album Wild Honey. The song is a ballad with lyrics that metaphorically relate nature to the essence of love.[1] It is the first composition recorded by the group that is in 3/4 time from beginning to end.[2]    Contents   1 Critical reception 2 Variations 3 Cover versions 4 References    Critical reception[edit] Music theorist Daniel Harrison called it "the most arresting and compositionally assured song on the album, and it echoes the formal and harmonic technique of 'God Only Knows'."[3] Stylus Magazine wrote: "'Let the Wind Blow' is a moody ballad that swirls and throbs with a subtle psychedelia more hinted at than indulged in; proof of a growing sophistication that improves upon the Smiley Smile formula."[4] In 1968, Gene Scullati said the song was further evidence of Wilson's "weird ear for melody".[5] PopMatters wrote that, in contrast to the Wild Honey single "Darlin'", "'Let the Wind Blow' ... is forlorn and urgent, with a gripping chorus and somber production. It’s fantastic."[6] Variations[edit] An alternate stereo mix of "Let the Wind Blow" was included on the rarities compilation Hawthorne CA (2001).[citation needed] A live performance of the song appears on the album The Beach Boys in Concert (1973).[citation needed] Cover versions[edit] See also: List of cover versions of Beach Boys songs  1995 – Brian Wilson, I Just Wasn't Made for These Times  References[edit]   ^ Greenwalk, Matthew.
