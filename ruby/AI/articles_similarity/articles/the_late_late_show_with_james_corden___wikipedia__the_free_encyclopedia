It is the fourth iteration of The Late Late Show. Currently airing in the U.S. at 12:37 a.m. Eastern and Pacific Time on Monday through Friday nights (following The Late Show with Stephen Colbert in the CBS late-night lineup), it is taped in front of a live studio audience Monday through Thursday afternoons – during weeks in which first-run episodes are scheduled to air – at CBS Television City in Los Angeles, California in Studio 56, directly above the Bob Barker Studio (Studio 33). It is produced by Fulwell 73 and CBS Television Studios. Corden was announced as the show's new host on September 8, 2014, succeeding Craig Ferguson.[1] Originally scheduled to premiere on March 9, 2015, CBS later pushed back its premiere to March 23, 2015, in order to use the NCAA basketball tournament as a means of promoting Corden's debut.[2]    Contents   1 Production 2 Episodes 3 Recurring segments 4 Broadcast 5 References 6 External links    Production[edit] Corden said he was "thrilled and honoured" and found it "hugely exciting ... to host such a prestigious show".[3] CBS Entertainment Chairman Nina Tassler said in a statement that Corden is a warm, charming and original performer whose "diverse range of creative instincts and performance talent" make him a "rare entertainment force". Tassler cited Corden's work in such media as theater, film and television, and called him "loved and respected" in all of them.[4] The show continues to be filmed at CBS Television City in Los Angeles.[5] Corden made a surprise guest appearance on predecessor Ferguson's program on December 16, 2014, two days prior to Ferguson's last broadcast as host, during which the two briefly discussed Corden taking over the show.[6] He also appeared on an episode hosted by Judd Apatow to job shadow, stating he wanted to "learn from his mistakes".[7] Unlike his predecessors, Corden's Late Late Show has a house band, nicknamed "Karen",[8] and led by Reggie Watts who also acts as the show's announcer. Reggie also performs as lead vocals, keyboards, beatboxing and programmer.[9] The other personnel in the band are Tim Young on lead guitars, Steve Scalfatti on keyboards, Hagar Ben Ari on bass, and Guillermo E. Brown on drums. The show's title sequence was originally supposed to be directed by J.J. Abrams but instead was filmed by the visual firm of Trollbäck + Company and Reggie Watts and the Late Late Show Band composed the theme song.[10] According to a report in the Daily Mail: "Corden hopes the credits will show him riding a BMX bike around Los Angeles, with other on-screen talent joining him as he reaches the CBS studio."[11] The show's executive producers are Rob Crabbe and Ben Winston.[7] The final product being James Corden and Reggie Watts going around LA in a Low Rider, LED bike, and some graphic and light painting with a Pixelstick. Trollbäck + Company put this statement below the video: "James Corden and Reggie Watts put the LA LA back into Late Late in a series fun vignettes filmed around Los Angeles for the identity of the new CBS Late Late Show. James originally wanted JJ Abrams to film him and Reggie scored to a Mark Ronson track. We were of course honored to take JJ's place as he was a bit busy filming a blockbuster! We managed to shoot everything in one night with LED bikes, a Lowrider, and a Pixelstick setting an eclectic visual tone for this experimental new show."[12] While an opening monologue is a staple of the late night talk show genre, Corden has suggested that as he is not a stand-up comedian, he will also be using alternatives to the traditional joke-heavy monologue.[13] The show also uses an interview format similar to that of British chat show The Graham Norton Show, in which all of the night's guests appear on stage simultaneously.[14] Episodes[edit] Main article: List of The Late Late Show with James Corden episodes Tom Hanks and Mila Kunis were Corden's first guests on March 23, 2015, for the debut episode featuring Corden and Hanks acting and singing their way through a retrospective of Hanks' career.[15] Later, after a prompt by Hanks, Corden appeared to score a coup by getting Mila Kunis to admit that she and Ashton Kutcher are married, but a source later claimed she was merely joking.[16] The episode scored 1.66 million viewers, the show's biggest Monday rating in more than three years.[17] First-run episodes aired every weeknight through the May 2015 sweeps period; then, beginning the week of May 25, the show scaled back its production schedule to four first-run episodes per week (differing from the previous iterations of the program, which produced Friday episodes, either the day of broadcast or farther in advance on the tape date of the Thursday edition), with the Friday episode consisting of a rebroadcast of a recent episode, as has become common with several other late-night talk shows (with the exception of The Late Show and The Tonight Show, which continue to produce first-run episodes on that night, and many airing on cable, which almost universally do not air episodes on Fridays at all). Even with Corden's debut week, Late Night with Seth Meyers still beat The Late Late Show in the ratings during the 12:35 a.m. time slot, with Meyers continuing to dominate that slot on a weekly basis. The May 20, 2015 episode, which followed the finale of Late Show with David Letterman, was the highest rated episode of The Late Late Show in the history of the franchise with an audience of 4 million viewers and a rating of 2.5.,[18] despite starting 20 minutes late due to Letterman's show running over its scheduled end time.[19] The episode featured Corden and Sting outside of the Ed Sullivan Theater singing "Every Breath You Take" in the show's cold open and a monologue with a Top Ten List among other tributes to Letterman.[20] Recurring segments[edit]  Carpool Karaoke, a segment in which James and musical guests sing along to their songs whilst driving in Los Angeles. Corden explained that the segment was inspired by a Gavin & Stacey-themed sketch he had participated in for the British charity television special Red Nose Day 2011, in which he sang along with George Michael in a car, stating that "Ben Winston and I always thought there was something very joyful about someone very, very famous singing their songs in an ordinary situation. We just had this idea: Los Angeles, traffic, the carpool lane — maybe this is something we could pull off." The segments, which have featured artists such as Selena Gomez, Stevie Wonder, One Direction, Adele, and Sia, have proven popular as viral videos on the Late Late Show's YouTube channel.[21][22][23] A Carpool Karaoke segment featuring Adele reached 42 million views within 5 days, making it the most viral video originating from a late night program since 2013 by beating the trailer for Captain America: Civil War, which premiered on Jimmy Kimmel Live and reached 31 million views in the same timeframe.[24] On March 10, 2016, CBS announced that a Carpool Karaoke-oriented Late Late Show primetime special would air on March 29, 2016, featuring highlights of the segment and a new Carpool Karaoke with Jennifer Lopez.[25] The Red Hot Chili Peppers appeared on the June 13, 2016 segment. During the filming, singer Anthony Kiedis saved the life of a baby. Kiedis said, "a woman came out of her house, holding a child saying ‘My baby, my baby, my baby can’t breathe!’ We all ran across the street, the woman thrust the baby into my arms, the baby was not breathing and I thought ‘I’m gonna try and do a little baby CPR real quick, see if I can get some air in this kid.’ Tried to open the mouth, [it was] like locked shut. So I started rubbing the belly, bubbles came out of the mouth, the eyes rolled back into place, the ambulance showed up and I handed the baby over, who was now breathing and fine, and we went back to Carpool Karaoke."[26][27] On June 2016, CBS partnered with McDonald's and Coca-Cola for Carpool Karaoke integration. CBS teamed up with the two brands for an integration in Carpool Karaoke with Selena Gomez. Talking Mentalist: Over the summer of 2015, where CBS had aired reruns of its drama programming as a lead-in to The Late Late Show to lead up towards the premiere of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, several episodes opened with Talking Mentalist—a parody of companion "after-shows" such as Talking Dead and Talking Bad, in which James and his guests would discuss the rerun of The Mentalist that had just aired. After CBS followed suit, the sketch was reprised as Talking Hawaii Five-0, which featured a guest appearance by Talking Dead host Chris Hardwick.[28] Celebrity Noses: A purported game segment surrounding the noses of celebrities, but every attempt to play Celebrity Noses is constantly interrupted by various complications, eventually preventing James from being able to perform the segment at all.[29][30] "Take a Break": A segment in which James Corden fills in for an employee whilst they take a break. "Drop the Mic": A segment in which James Corden performs a rap battle with celebrity guests. Notable guests include, Anne Hathaway, David Schwimmer, Rebel Wilson and Kevin Hart.  Broadcast[edit] In Canada, The Late Late Show with James Corden is aired by CTV in simulcast with CBS. The program formerly aired on sister network CTV Two, but moved to the main CTV network on February 8, 2016, switching with Late Night with Seth Meyers.[31][32] In Australia, the series was purchased by CBS's Australian partner Network Ten.[33][34] It premiered on Network Ten's sister network Eleven on May 24, 2015 on a seven-day-a-week airing schedule to catch up with the current run through the northern hemisphere summer (by September and the start of the new American television season it had caught up and now airs on a day-delay with encores on the weekend); CBS holds a 1/3 stake in Eleven.[35] In New Zealand the show began to air on state-owned broadcaster TVNZ's channel Duke, from March 20 2016. In Asia, the show premiered on August 3 2015 on RTL CBS Entertainment. It airs weeknights at 11:45PM (UTC+08:00), following The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.[36] In the UK and Ireland the show airs on Sky’s ‘On Demand’ service, with each episode available the day after it’s US broadcast.
