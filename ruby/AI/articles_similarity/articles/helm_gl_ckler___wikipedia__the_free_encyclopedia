Glöckler raced a Deutsch-Bonnet in Formula 3 in 1951, and won the sports car racing event at the 1953 Eifelrennen with a new Porsche 550.[1] He also won the sports car class Alpine Cup trophy in the 1951 Österreichische Alpenfahrt rally driving a highly modified Renault 4CV.[2] He entered the 1953 German Grand Prix in an Equipe Anglaise Cooper, this being his one and only attempt at a World Championship race, but he blew his engine during qualifying and so did not compete in the race. He raced a Porsche 550 in the 1953 24 Hours of Le Mans with Hans Herrmann, and again in the 1954 24 Hours of Le Mans with Richard von Frankenberg. Until recently, Helm Glöckler GmbH in Frankfurt bore his name, running a motorcycle dealer and workshop, and other enterprises.
