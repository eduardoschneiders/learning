It is in four movements:  Vivace Allegretto Giubiloso Lento  The symphony is scored for 2 flutes, piccolo, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons. 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, 2 percussionists, harp and strings. The symphony is dedicated to Anthony Day, who looked after Malcolm Arnold from 1984 to 2006. It was first performed in 1988 by the now defunct Goldsmiths' College's NCOS Symphony Orchestra conducted by Charles Groves in Greenwich in the presence of a selected audience. The first professional and public performance was given on Monday 20 January 1992 by the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra in Manchester also conducted by Charles Groves. The last movement is as long as the previous three together, uses a theme similar to the last movement of Tchaikowsky 6th Symphony, and is very sparsely scored and bleak.
