It is the last Can album to feature Japanese vocalist Damo Suzuki.    Contents   1 Content  1.1 Album cover   2 Legacy 3 Track listing 4 Personnel 5 External links 6 References    Content[edit] On Future Days, the band employs more of an ambient sound than on their previous efforts, especially on the title track and the twenty-minute "Bel Air". The latter of these has been described by critics as being gloriously expansive and Can's most impressionistic song, with "an almost painterly sense of blended colors and landscapes."[2][3] Album cover[edit] The album cover shows a Psi sign in the middle (drawn in the same style as the font used for the cover) and the I Ching symbol Ting / the Cauldron sign underneath the title. The surrounding graphics are based on the Jugenstil artstyle. Some versions of the vinyl album have a slightly different cover in which the graphics don't have a light emboss or in which the lightly reflective gold tint is replaced by a flat yellow instead. These differents are also present on the CD releases. Eventhough not all versions of the covers are fully identical, the tracks do not differ on any release version whatsoever. Legacy[edit] The album was ranked number 8 on Rolling Stone's 50 Greatest Prog Rock Albums of All Time list.[5] Pitchfork named it the 56th greatest album of the 1970s.[6] Stylus ranked it at #160 on their Top 101-200 Albums of All time list.[7] Mojo also named it the 62nd greatest album of all time.[8] Track listing[edit] All songs written and composed by Can.    Side A   No. Title Length   1.
