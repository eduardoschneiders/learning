Studying at University of California, Berkeley (1999-2003), he received B.A. degrees in English and in Linguistics.[2] He received an M.A. in Linguistics from University of California, San Diego (2003–06).[2] According to an interview given to the publication Conlangs Monthly, he had his first contact with constructed languages while still in Berkeley, after attending an Esperanto class in 2000.[4] In 2009, the television network HBO needed a fictional language for a new television series and turned to the Language Creation Society for help. This resulted in a contest, which Peterson won.[5][6] Peterson is best known for creating the Dothraki and Valyrian languages for the HBO series Game of Thrones (since 2009) and the Castithan, Irathient and Omec languages for Syfy's Defiance (since 2011); but he has been creating languages since 2000.[2][7] He also created the language used by the Dark Elves in the movie Thor: The Dark World.[8] In 2007, he co-founded the Language Creation Society,[2] with nine other language creators[2] and served as its president (2011–2014).[9] When creating the two full and two smaller languages for Defiance, Peterson also developed a number system.[10]    Contents   1 Filmography 2 Bibliography 3 References 4 External links    Filmography[edit]   Year Title Language(s)   2011–2016 Game of Thrones Dothraki, Valyrian   2013–2015 Defiance Kastithanu, L'Irathi, Indojisnen, Kinuk'aaz   2013 Thor: The Dark World Shiväisith   2014 Star-Crossed Sondiv   2014–2015 Dominion Lishepus   2014–2016 The 100 Trigedasleng   2015 Penny Dreadful Verbis Diablo   2016 The Shannara Chronicles Noalath   2016 Emerald City Inha, Munja'kin   Bibliography[edit]   Year Title Publisher ISBN   2014 The Zaanics Deceit (co-author) Nina Post, LLC ISBN 978-1495461347   2014 Living Language Dothraki Living Language ISBN 978-0804160865   2015 The Art of Language Invention Penguin Books ISBN 978-0143126461   References[edit]   ^ "The birth of David Joshua Peterson".
