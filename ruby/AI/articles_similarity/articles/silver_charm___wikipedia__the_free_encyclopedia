Trained by Bob Baffert and ridden by Gary Stevens, he is remembered most for winning the 1997 Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes in the Triple Crown.

He was voted the 1997 Eclipse Award for Outstanding Three-Year-Old Male Horse. Racing at age 4, Silver Charm won the 1998 Dubai World Cup. For some time, he stood at Three Chimneys Farm. Then, purchased by the Japan Breeders Association, Silver Charm was retired to stud in Japan. He stood at the Shizunai Stallion Station in December 2004. In 2008, he stood at the Shichinohe Stallion Station and in 2009, at the Iburi Stallion Station. In the Blood-Horse magazine List of the Top 100 Racehorses of the 20th Century, Silver Charm was ranked #63. In 2007, Silver Charm was elected to the United States' Racing Hall of Fame. Stud career and retirement[edit] When Silver Charm went to Japan to the Shizunai Stallion Station in 2004, a clause in his sales contract called a "buy-back clause" was included. Ever since the death of Kentucky Derby winner Ferdinand, who was sent to a slaughterhouse in Japan when his breeding days were done, the New York Owners and Breeder's Association, based in Saratoga Springs, New York, has begun asking for a small voluntary per-race charge (collected from owners of New York Breds) called the "Ferdinand Fee." These monies are intended for the Bluegrass Charities and the Thoroughbred Charities of America to help them fund racehorse rescue and retirement groups. Some owners are now including buy-back clauses within their stallion contracts. Silver Charm is one of those stallions, as is Roses in May. On October 29, 2014, it was announced jointly by Three Chimneys Farm and Old Friends Farm that Silver Charm would return from Japan and be retired permanently at Old Friends Equine in Georgetown, Kentucky. [1] Beverly Lewis and her son, Steve, paid to bring Silver Charm back to Kentucky.
