Beginning July 2013, Nepal Telecom has expanded its 3G bandwidth by replacing old ZTE NodeB's with equipment from Huawei in more than 38 districts all over Nepal which can provide speed up to 7.2 Mbit/s. Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Lalitpur are the only areas in Nepal which have been swapped by Nepal Telecom's 3G network, covering almost all parts. The 3G expansion project started from July 2013 initially covering whole Kathmandu Valley and then it swiftly moved towards the far western region of Nepal. After swapping far western cities, mid western region was the next area to be swapped. Mid Western Region's major cities and areas got fast 3G networks thereafter. However, only headquarters of districts were swapped by new improved BTS towers. The central region areas after Kathmandu Valley like Chitwan, Hetauda, Nuwakot, Sindhupalchowk, Kavrepalanchowk, Rasuwa, Dhading etc. were upgraded with the new HSDPA network. The eastern region areas like Dharan, Biratnagar, Damak, Illam, Taplejung also have been provided the new improved 3G network.[citation needed] The company plans to provide within all 75 districts of Nepal 4G service by 2017/18.[citation needed] but it hasn't been able to keep up its pace to meet its targets. At present except Kathmandu Valley & some cities, entire parts of other districts aren't covered by 3G network of Nepal Telecom. Only headquarters & surrounding areas are swapped. Remaining areas & parts are planned to be swapped in upcoming years. Awards and recognition[edit]  Nepal Telecom was honoured with No.1 Taxpayer' title in FY 2009-10[10] and FY 2010-11.
