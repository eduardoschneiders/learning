(January 2010) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)     Black Coats & Bandages      Studio album by Clann Zú   Released 1 June 2004   Recorded Newmarket Studios (Melbourne)   Genre Art rock Slowcore   Length 46:52   Label G7 Welcoming Committee   Clann Zú chronology      Rua (2003) Black Coats & Bandages (2004)       Black Coats & Bandages is the second full length album by Irish-Australian band Clann Zú. This album has much sparser instrumentation and less electronic influence than Clann Zú's previous album, Rua, and a heavier use of the Irish language. Black Coats & Bandages explores similar issues as Rua, but also touches on themes of imperialism, war, organized religion, and personal struggles. Reception[edit] AllMusic's Stewart Mason expressed a difficulty in describing Black Coats & Bandages: "close to impossible to sum up in an easy sentence, because there are so many comparisons" and decided "[it] is undeniably flawed, and several listens will be necessary before it all begins to make some kind of sense, but as perhaps the most wide-ranging and eclectic band this side of Canada's Broken Social Scene, Clann Zu continue to impress."[1] Adam White of Punknews.org compared it to the group's debut album Rua, and found that it "is completely raw, shockingly so. It's a record of mid to slow paced ballads, sparely arranged and sparsely produced. The prevailing theme in the title track (and the band's press) is 'funeral oration'."[2] Maarten Schiethart of PennyBlackMusic noted that when "De Barra sings rather than whines, his voice shows a fine soulful style, yet when the preaching starts – Black Coats and Bandages is on G7 Welcoming Committee after all – the Clann Zú sound becomes pretty mundane".[3] Track listing[edit] Music by Clann Zú; lyrics by Declan de Barra.
