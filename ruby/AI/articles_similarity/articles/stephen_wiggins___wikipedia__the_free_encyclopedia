Kaper   Known for Fluid dynamics, nonlinear dynamics and chaos in classical mechanics and mechanics applied to atomic systems   Stephen Ray Wiggins is an American applied mathematician, born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and best known for his contributions in nonlinear dynamics, chaos theory and nonlinear phenomena, influenced heavily by his PhD advisor Philip Holmes, whom he studied under at Cornell University. He is actively working on the advancement of computational applied mathematics at the University of Bristol, where he was the head of the Mathematics Department until 2008. Previously he was a professor at Caltech in Pasadena, California.[1]    Contents   1 Field of study  1.1 Nonlinear dynamics and chaos 1.2 Transport theory and fluid dynamics   2 References 3 External links    Field of study[edit] Stephen Wiggins contributed in many different areas of mathematical physics from classical dynamical systems point of view. Nonlinear dynamics and chaos[edit] His book Applied nonlinear dynamical systems and Chaos cited more than 3000 times.[2] Transport theory and fluid dynamics[edit] His recent works on chaotic mixing [2] attract considerable interest, with the leading expert in the area, Professor Ottino.
