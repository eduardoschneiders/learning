There are great views from it, and there's a nice hiking path to see the northern part of provinces of Cadiz and Málaga as well as the southern part of the Seville one. There is another Puerto de las Palomas in Andalusia located further northeast in the Sierra de Cazorla/Sierra del Segura area. Access from Zahara de la Sierra is performed by a road very winding and steep slopes.[1] See also[edit]  Puerto del Boyar  References[edit]  ^ "En bicicleta por la Sierra de Cádiz -III- Los grandes puertos "  Coordinates: 36°47′15″N 5°22′35″W﻿ / ﻿36.78750°N 5.37639°W﻿ / 36.78750; -5.37639     This article about a location in Andalusia, Spain, is a stub.
