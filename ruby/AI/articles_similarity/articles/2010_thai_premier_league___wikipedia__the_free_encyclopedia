Therefore at the end of season the three teams in the Thai Premier League that finished the season in the bottom three places (14th, 15th and 16th) would face the fourth, fifth and sixth teams from Division One in a promotion/relegation series.[1] The six teams will be divided into two groups of three. They will meet each other in their group on a home-and-away basis with the winner of each group earning spots in the top flight next season. Thai Premier League All-Star Exhibition game[edit] See also: Thai Premier League All-Star Football Teams[edit] Sriracha, Chula United and Nakhon Pathom were relegated to the 2010 Thai Division 1 League after finishing the 2009 season in the bottom three places. The three relegated teams were replaced by 2009 Thai Division 1 League champions Police United, runners-up Royal Thai Army and third place Sisaket. TTM Samut Sakhon and PEA were renamed to TTM Phichit and Buriram PEA, they moved location to Phichit and Buriram. PEA renamed after the club takeover by Newin Chidchob. TOT were renamed too, they were renamed to TOT-CAT.
