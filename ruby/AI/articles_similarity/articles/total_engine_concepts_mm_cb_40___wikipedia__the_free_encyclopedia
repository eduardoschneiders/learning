Global Motors originally designed a 1/2 VW engine for use in light aircraft. The company and its designs were then sold to Mosler Motors. Warren Mosler specialized in racing engines and added the engine to the list of products eventually marketed under the company name Total Engine Concepts. The engine was dropped from production in 1998.[1] The CB-40 was re-engineered to overcome problems of vibration and cooling in the original design.[2] Suited for ultralight use and single seat light sport aircraft, the engine weighs 86 lbs and produces 40 hp (30 kW). The engine uses a short aluminum crankcase with redesigned oil galleries for improved lubrication. The engine is counterweight balanced with a drop-forged crankshaft. Variants[edit]  CB-40 Base model 40 hp (30 kW). CB-35 35 hp (26 kW) variant with a shorter stroke.
