Typically it is a municipal level city department focused on a particular district or corridor that has become neglected or blighted. In many cases this is the city's original downtown that has been supplanted in importance by a regional shopping center. Redevelopment efforts often focus on reducing crime, destroying unsuitable buildings and dwellings, restoring historic features and structures, and creating new landscaping, housing and business opportunities mixed with expanded government services and transportation infrastructure.[1] Examples[edit]  The Las Vegas Redevelopment Agency has created many project that have led to jobs growth and city beautification. The city of Richmond, California used its agency to refurbish Macdonald Avenue, Macdonald 80 Shopping Center the city's downtown and a transit village at the Richmond BART/Amtrak station and the creating of the Richmond Greenway among many other projects. The city of Fremont, California engaged in a redevelopment of Irvington station, focused on transit oriented development.  References[edit]   ^ Duran-Brown, Bernadette (May 27, 2015).
