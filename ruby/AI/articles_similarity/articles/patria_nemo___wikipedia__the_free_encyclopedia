It is a lighter version of the AMOS mortar system, which is also being field tested. The NEMO can be fitted to most APCs and also to smaller landing craft, such as the Finnish Jurmo class landing craft or the Swedish Combat Boat 90. The first customer of the weapon system was the Slovenian Army,[1] which ordered 24, while the United Arab Emirates Naval Forces bought 12 patrol boats, where some were to be equipped with NEMO mortars.[2] Saudi Arabia bought 36 turrets to equip its LAV II vehicles.[3]     Contents   1 See also 2 Operators  2.1 Current operators   3 References 4 External links    See also[edit]  AMOS Light-weight Combat Vehicle System  Operators[edit]     Map of NEMO operators in blue   Current operators[edit]   Finland  Saudi Arabia  Slovenia  Sweden  United Arab Emirates  References[edit]  ^ "Slovenian Army’s New APCs: Patria's AMVs", Defense Industry Daily, 21 December 2006.
