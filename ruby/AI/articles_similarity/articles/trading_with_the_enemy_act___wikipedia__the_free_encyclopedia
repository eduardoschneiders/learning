The Bill for an Act with this short title will have been known as a Trading with the Enemy Bill during its passage through the Parliament of the United Kingdom or the United States Congress. Trading with the Enemy Acts is also a generic name for a class of legislation generally passed during or approaching a war that prohibit not just mercantile activities with foreign nationals, but also acts that might assist the enemy.[1] While originally limited to wartime, in the 20th century these Acts were applied in cases of national emergency as well. For example, in 1940, before the United States entry into World War II the president imposed broad prohibitions on the transfer of property in which Norway or Denmark, or any citizen or national of those countries, or any other person aiding those countries, had any interest, with the exception of transfers which were licensed under the regulations of the Department of the Treasury.[2]    Contents   1 List  1.1 France 1.2 United Kingdom 1.3 United States 1.4 Israel   2 See also 3 Notes 4 Further reading    List[edit] France[edit]  Continental System, French Napoleonic edict from 1806 to 1814  United Kingdom[edit]  The Trading with the Enemy Act 1914 The Trading with the Enemy Amendment Act 1914 (5 & 6 Geo 5 c 12) The Trading with the Enemy Amendment Act 1915 (5 & 6 Geo 5 c 79) The Trading with the Enemy (Extension of Powers) Act 1915 (5 & 6 Geo 5 c 98) The Trading with the Enemy Amendment Act 1916 (5 & 6 Geo 5 c 105) The Trading with the Enemy (Copyright) Act 1916 (6 & 7 Geo 5 c 32) The Trading with the Enemy and Export of Prohibited Goods Act 1916 (6 & 7 Geo 5 c 52) The Trading with the Enemy (Amendment) Act 1918 (8 & 9 Geo 5 c 31) The Trading with the Enemy Act 1939 (2 & 3 Geo 6 c 89)  United States[edit]  Trading with the Enemy Act, a 1917 Act of the United States; still in force.[3]  Israel[edit] The British Trading with the Enemy Act 1939 was applied to Mandatory Palestine, as to other British-ruled territories. On the creation of Israel in 1948, it was retained as an Israeli law and the various Arab countries named in it as "The Enemy". It is still in force as of 2013, though Egypt and Jordan were removed from its application with the respective peace agreements Israel signed with them.
