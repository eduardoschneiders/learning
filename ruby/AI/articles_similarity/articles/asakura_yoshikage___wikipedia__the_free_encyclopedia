Asakura Yoshikage (朝倉 義景?, October 12, 1533 – September 16, 1573) was a Japanese daimyo of the Sengoku period (1467–1573) who ruled a part of Echizen Province in present-day Fukui Prefecture. Yoshikage's conflicts with Oda Nobunaga (1534–1582) resulted in his death and the destruction of the Asakura clan and its castle, Ichijōdani Castle.[1][2][3]    Contents   1 Early career 2 Conflicts with Oda Nobunaga 3 Death 4 Ichijōdani Asakura Family Historic Ruins 5 References 6 External links    Early career[edit] Yoshikage was born at the Asakura clan castle in Echizen Province, Ichijōdani Castle, in the present-day Kidanouchi district of Fukui, Fukui Prefecture. His father was Asakura Takakage (1493–1548) and his mother is presumed to be the daughter of Takeda Motomitsu.[3] The Asakura had displaced the Shiba clan as the shugo military commanders of part of Echizen in 1471.[1] Yoshikage succeeded his father as head of the Asakura clan and castle lord of Ichijōdani Castle in 1548.[2][4] He proved to be adept at political and diplomatic management, markedly demonstrated by the Asakura negotiations with the Ikkō-ikki in Echizen. As a result of the negotiations and effective governance by Yoshikage, Echizen enjoyed a period of relative domestic stability compared to the rest of Sengoku era Japan. Consequently, Echizen became a site for refugees fleeing the violence in the Kansai region. Ichijōdani became a center of culture modeled on the capital at Kyōto.[1] Conflicts with Oda Nobunaga[edit] After the capture of Kyoto, Ashikaga Yoshiaki appointed Yoshikage regent and requested Asakura aid in driving Nobunaga out of the capital.[3] As a result, Oda Nobunaga launched an invasion of Echizen. Due to Yoshikage’s lack of military skill, Oda's forces were successful at the Siege of Kanegasaki (in modern-day Tsuruga city), leaving the entire Asakura Domain open to invasion.[1][5][6] Yoshikage benefited from the military conflicts between Azai Nagamasa (1545–1573), brother-in-law of Oda Nobunaga. Azai had launched a pincer attack strategy against Nobunaga in Kanegasaki, but the coalition of Asakura and Azai forces failed in the task of capturing Nobunaga.[3] In the Battle of Anegawa in 1570, Yoshikaga and Nagamasa were defeated by the numerically superior Tokugawa clan headed by Tokugawa Ieyasu (1543–1616).[1] Death[edit] Yoshikage fled to Hiezan (Enryaku-ji, Hiei Monastery) after the Battle of Anegawa and negotiated a reconciliation with Nobunaga and was able to avoid conflict for three years.[3] Yoshikage was eventually betrayed by his cousin, Asakura Kageakira (1529–1574) in 1573. He was forced to commit suicide by seppuku at Rokubō Kenshō-ji, a temple which was located in present-day Ōno, Fukui Prefecture. He was 41 years old.[1][3] The Asakura clan was destroyed with the death of Yoshikage.[2] Ichijōdani Asakura Family Historic Ruins[edit] The former Asakura residence in Fukui Prefecture was excavated in 1967 and revealed the ruins of the castle, residences, and gardens of Ichijōdani. The site has been designated a Special Places of Scenic Beauty, Special Historic Sites, and an Important Cultural Properties of Japan as the Ichijōdani Asakura Family Historic Ruins. The site covers 278 hectares (690 acres). References[edit]   ^ a b c d e f "Asakura Yoshikage". Encyclopedia of Japan. Tokyo: Shogakukan. 2012. OCLC 56431036.
