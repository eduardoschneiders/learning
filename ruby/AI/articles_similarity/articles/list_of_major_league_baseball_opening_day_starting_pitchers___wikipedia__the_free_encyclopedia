          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                            Jump to:     navigation,      search          Major League Baseball (MLB) is the highest level of play in North American professional baseball, and is the organization that operates the National League and the American League. In 2000, the two leagues were officially disbanded as separate legal entities, and all of their rights and functions were consolidated in the commissioner's office.[1] Since that time, MLB has operated as a single league, and constitutes one of the major professional sports leagues of the United States. It is composed of 30 teams.[2] Opening Day is the day on which professional baseball leagues begin their regular season. For MLB and most of the minor leagues, this day falls during the first week of April. For baseball fans, Opening Day serves as a symbol of rebirth; writer Thomas Boswell once penned a book titled, Why Time Begins On Opening Day.[3] Many feel that the occasion represents a newness or a chance to forget last season, in that the 30 major league clubs and their millions of fans begin with 0-0 records.[3] Being named the Opening Day starter is an honor, which is often given to the player who is expected to lead the pitching staff that season.[4] It is often given to the pitcher who had the best season the year prior,[5] though there are various strategic reasons why a team's best pitcher might not start on Opening Day.[6]    Contents   1 National League  1.1 Eastern Division  1.1.1 Atlanta Braves 1.1.2 Miami Marlins 1.1.3 New York Mets 1.1.4 Philadelphia Phillies 1.1.5 Washington Nationals   1.2 Central Division  1.2.1 Chicago Cubs 1.2.2 Cincinnati Reds 1.2.3 Milwaukee Brewers 1.2.4 Pittsburgh Pirates 1.2.5 St. Louis Cardinals   1.3 Western Division  1.3.1 Arizona Diamondbacks 1.3.2 Colorado Rockies 1.3.3 Los Angeles Dodgers 1.3.4 San Diego Padres 1.3.5 San Francisco Giants     2 American League  2.1 Eastern Division  2.1.1 Baltimore Orioles 2.1.2 Boston Red Sox 2.1.3 New York Yankees 2.1.4 Tampa Bay Rays 2.1.5 Toronto Blue Jays   2.2 Central Division  2.2.1 Chicago White Sox 2.2.2 Cleveland Indians 2.2.3 Detroit Tigers 2.2.4 Kansas City Royals 2.2.5 Minnesota Twins   2.3 Western Division  2.3.1 Houston Astros 2.3.2 Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim 2.3.3 Oakland Athletics 2.3.4 Seattle Mariners 2.3.5 Texas Rangers     3 References 4 External links    National League[edit] Eastern Division[edit] Atlanta Braves[edit] Main article: List of Atlanta Braves Opening Day starting pitchers The Atlanta Braves National League franchise originated in Boston, Massachusetts in 1871.
