          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                            Jump to:     navigation,      search          Aphacitis (Ancient Greek: Ἀφακῖτις) was an epithet of the goddess Aphrodite from Greek mythology, derived from the town of Aphaca (modern Afqa) in Coele-Syria, where she had a celebrated temple with an oracle, which was destroyed by the command of the emperor Constantine.[1] At the temple there was a small pool into which worshippers would throw offerings. If the offerings sank, it was proof they were acceptable to Aphrodite.[2] Delegations would be sent from quite far away to the shrine during festivals to offer donations to the goddess here.[3] Notes[edit]   ^ Zosimus, Historia Novia 1.58 ^ White, John F.
