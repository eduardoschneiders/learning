It is a duet with country musician George Jones. It was released in November 1990 as the first single from his album of duets Heroes & Friends. "A Few Ole Country Boys" peaked at number 8 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart[1] and reached number 4 on the Canadian RPM country Tracks chart.

Ironically, artists like Travis, Dwight Yoakam, and Ricky Van Shelton were indirectly responsible for nudging older country artists off the charts during this time as country radio became obsessed with tapping into a younger market. The single was significant because it made Jones the only country artist in history to have a Top 10 song in five consecutive decades. Travis has always cited Jones as a primary influence and the song reflects this, alluding to the younger singer's troubled past (Travis had been a juvenile delinquent) and how he drew inspiration from Jones. George was equally complimentary in his 1995 memoir I Lived to Tell It All, singling out Travis for praise while lamenting how country radio had turned its back on older country artists: "If Randy Travis had come to town last month, he probably wouldn't have gotten a record deal. He's too good and too original...And he doesn't wear a cowboy hat or pimple cream. Today's labels are looking for pretty boys and girls." At the end of the song, Travis parodies Jones' idiosyncratic phrasing.
