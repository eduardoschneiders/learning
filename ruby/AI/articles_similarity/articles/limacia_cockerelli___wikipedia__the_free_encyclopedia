It has also been reported in the Gulf of California at Bahía de los Ángeles.[4]     Limacia cockerelli   Description[edit] This species reaches lengths of 26 mm. It has long dorsal papillae with white branchial plumes.[5] It is found in two forms. The northern form has white tubercles down the middle of the dorsum. The second form, found in areas south of Point Conception have tubercles that are slightly longer and tipped with orange. Intermediate forms exist in central and northern California.[6] Another form in California has large red blotches on the dorsum. The eggs of the Limacia cockerelli are pink and develop after 17 days, (at 10-13 degrees C), into hatching planktotrophic veligers. It is likely that these forms represent a species complex.[7] Diet[edit] This animal preys exclusively on the orange-brown coloured bryozoan, Hincksina velata.[4] References[edit]   ^ MacFarland, Frank Mace (1905) A preliminary account of the Dorididae of Monterey Bay, California.
