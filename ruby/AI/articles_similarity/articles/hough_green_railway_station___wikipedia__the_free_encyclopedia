It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade listed building.[1] The station is on the Liverpool-Warrington-Manchester Line 10 miles 42 chains (16.9 km) east of Liverpool Lime Street[2] and all trains serving it are operated by Northern.

Facilities[edit] The station is of the standard Cheshire Lines Committee style and, like other Merseyside stations, is staffed full-time. There is a car park outside. Part of the station building is occupied by a Taxi firm. The Eastbound platform features the original brick-built waiting room which is still in use. Services[edit] Services operate approximately half-hourly (Monday-Saturday daytimes) in each direction, towards Liverpool South Parkway and Liverpool Lime Street to the west and towards Widnes and Manchester Oxford Road in the east. Services are less frequent in the late evenings and on Sundays, usually every 60 minutes. Most services are operated by Northern, but one train per day to Liverpool Lime Street is operated by East Midlands Trains.[3] Although the station is outside the metropolitan county of Merseyside, tickets issued by Merseytravel (which usually can only be used within Merseyside) are valid for travel to and from Hough Green.
