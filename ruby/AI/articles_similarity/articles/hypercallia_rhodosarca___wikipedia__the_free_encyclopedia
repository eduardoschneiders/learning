It was described by Walsingham in 1912. It is found in Guatemala and Bolivia.[1] The wingspan is about 18 mm. The forewings are bright rosy red, much reticulated at the base and towards the apex with bright golden yellow, which forms a series of about eight subtermmal spots around the apex. A bright rosy purple suffusion covering the dorsum, except its basal fourth, extends upward across the cell nearly to the costa, its inner edge being marked on the cell by a round silvery white spot, a small white dot lying at its outer edge on the end of the cell-this suffusion is not clearly defined, but blends with the ground-colour towards the termen. The hindwings are rosy pink.[2] References[edit]   ^ Hypercallia at funet.fi. ^ Biol. centr.-amer. Lep. Heterocera 4 : 125      This article relating to the Gelechioidea superfamily is a stub.
