(December 2009) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)     Associate Minister of National Defence of Canada         Incumbent Kent Hehr since 4 November 2015    Department of National Defence   Style The Honourable   Member of    Cabinet Privy Council      Appointer Governor General of Canada   Term length At Her Majesty's pleasure   Inaugural holder Charles Gavan Power   Formation July 12, 1940   Website www.forces.gc.ca   The Associate Minister of National Defence (French: Ministre associé de la Défense nationale) is a member of the Canadian cabinet responsible for various files within the defence department as assigned by the Prime Minister or Defence Minister. The position was created in 1940 during World War II under the War Measures Act along with the creation of a Minister of Defence for Air and a Minister of Defence for Naval Services. These positions lapsed with the end of the war. The position of Associate Minister of Defence was recreated in 1953 when the National Defence Act was amended to provide for the appointment in peacetime. This post remained vacant under Pierre Trudeau, Joe Clark and John Turner. Brian Mulroney revived the position but it was abolished under Kim Campbell when she decreased the size of cabinet from 35 to 24 ministers. The post was also not used under Jean Chrétien. This position reappeared on December 12, 2003, when Paul Martin chose his first cabinet and named Albina Guarnieri as the Associate Minister of National Defence and Minister of State for Civil Preparedness, and the portfolio passed to Mauril Bélanger in a subsequent reshuffle. Stephen Harper did not name anyone to the position until his May 18, 2011 reshuffle, when Julian Fantino was appointed to the portfolio. The position was left vacant by Harper in the July 15, 2013 cabinet shuffle.
