In some countries the intended use of the work (educational, scientific, parodist, etc.) may also be a factor determining the scope of this right. Europe[edit] The right to quote is especially important in continental Europe copyright law, where it covers some of the practices known elsewhere as fair use. European jurisprudence is gradually extending the amount of uses permitted under the right to quote, with some limits.[1] France[edit] In France, it is illegal to reproduce someone's work without their approval. But if the work is published, i.e. no longer being edited prior to release, small quotations are legal.[4] Germany[edit] In Germany, the right to quote is extended considerably for research purposes and may even encompass complete works (e. g. texts, pictures, music or videos).[5] Poland[edit] In Poland, the right to quote allows quotation of excerpts of works and small works as a whole, provided that this is justified by teaching, review, explanation[6] or caricatural motivation.[7] References[edit]  ^ a b Senftleben, Martin, Bridging the Differences between Copyright's Legal Traditions – The Emerging EC Fair Use Doctrine (June 15, 2010).
