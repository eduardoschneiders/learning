NISAU was created to provide a unifying voice for students with Indian heritage (whether home-grown in the UK or international) and promote, educate and celebrate Indian culture with people of all communities. NISAU aims to bring together all Indian student societies and alumni in the UK on one platform, promoting the Indo-UK relationship.[1] NISAU is trying to create a unique ecosystem where students and alumni of Indian origin are united to jointly work towards the causes of India and Britain. It hopes to create a platform that can instill in the ethos of charitable living, leadership, patriotism and entrepreneurship amongst Indian origin youth in the UK. Supporters of the organisation include its Patrons Member of Parliament Virendra Sharma, Dr Rami Ranger CBE and Baroness Usha Prashar.[2] Its President is Sanam Arora,[3] General Secretary Benaisha Mehta, and Vice Presidents are Saatvik Bansal, Vikram Duhan[4] and Rhea Ranjan.[5][6] Honorary Fellows of the NISAU are Mr Javed Akhtar, Mrs Shabana Azmi[7] and former Chief Election Commissioner of India, Dr SY Quraishi. [8] In order to better reflect the requirements of its members and in order to fulfill its key aim of uniting students and alumni on one platform, NISU was rebranded as NISAU in 2016.

It stands as a portal for Indian students and alumni, both from India and the diaspora for all their needs while in the UK. NISAU is the umbrella body of Indian and India-related societies at various university societies, across the UK. Aims of NISAU are: (a) To become the representative voice of Indian students studying at educational institutions in the UK (b) To support Indian students during their higher education in the UK - academic, professional and personal (before, during and after studies) (c) To develop future leaders, role models and ambassadors in the UK and in India (d) To further the Indo-UK relationship (e) To promote British Higher education in India and increase student exchange between both countries (f) To develop a system where UK educated Indian students are able to share their global knowledge and experience in India on a large scale and (g) To promote and celebrate Indian culture in the UK, upholding its core principles: ‘truth always prevails’, ‘unity in diversity’ and ‘the world is a family’ Activities[edit] The National Indian Students and Alumni Union being a youth movement believes in delivering by taking a lead. Despite being a relatively young organisation, it has emerged as a voice of the Indian diaspora and Indian students in the UK getting accolades and appreciation from all corners.[9] Most Indian and India – related societies in the UK are affiliated to NISAU and NISAU campaigns on issues affecting Indian students based in Britain. The most prominent campaign that NISAU is championing is raising awareness about issues surrounding international Indian students in the UK. NISAU was the first body to actively bring to stakeholder notice the plight of Indian students trapped in the vicious cycle of bogus colleges. It was to provide a platform for these issues to be brought to the attention of the respective governments that NISAU had been invited by the Indian High Commissioner of the UK to deliver an address at the Regional Pravasi Bharatiya Divas 2014[10] to discuss issues concerning the Indian students and youth in the UK.[11][12] The activities of NISAU, in brief, can be summarized as: Student Support[edit] (a) Support the Indian youth throughout their educational journey in the UK – pre-arrival, during their stay as students and post-graduation as alumni of the UK, and direct them towards a fruitful British education and contribution to their universities; (b) Represent students and alumni caught up in issues such as those of Immigration and Bogus Colleges (c) Support students and alumni in developing their professional skills through offering internships and career advice with the aim of generating skilled professionals within the British Economy (c) Support students and alumni through their personal journey in the UK; and (d) Voluntary work – promoting charitable ethos and work ethics Society Support[edit] (a) Guidance and support to society executives in their initiatives – events, fundraising, HR, media et al.; (b) Creation of Indian societies at universities where there are none, promoting leadership, culture and entrepreneurship; and (c) Organization of events Political and Economic Initiatives[edit] Pravasi Bharatiya Divas[edit] NISAU is playing an active role in pitching the voice of the Indian diaspora in the UK and has represented the British Indian diaspora at various governmental and non-governmental forums including at the flagship diaspora event organized by the Indian Government – Pravasi Bharatiya Divas 2015 where NISAU President Sanam Arora was one of the only 5 speakers selected from the United Kingdom.[13] In 2016, NISAU was invited to deliver an address on how the Indian diaspora can participate in India's transition to a knowledge economy and this was met with great response.[14] 2015 UK Parliamentary Elections[edit] NISAU also ran a special campaign called ‘My Vote Matters’ during the 2015 UK Parliamentary Elections urging the British Indian diaspora to exercise its voting privileges as well as urging commonwealth students to vote. This also included the launch of an International Student Manifesto.[4][15][16] Immigration and Higher Education in the UK[edit] A key initiative the organization is involved in is about current and future immigration policies. It has participated in various governmental and non-governmental level discussions about future immigration policies. Although NISAU is campaigning for post study visa for students after graduation from an UK university, as highlighted by its "Fair Visa Fair Chance" initiative or by providing oral and written evidence to UK All Party Parliamentary Group on PSW visa,[5] it has criticized strongly any visa abuses or any fraud practice to obtain a UK visa.[17] NISAU was the first in the UK to propose what is now the Tier 5 internship scheme. This was proposed in an address at the Westminster Legal Policy Forum.[18] At this forum NISAU highlighted the importance of international students in the UK, with a focus on the needs and desires of Indian students.[19] Given the success NISAU has had in bringing about awareness about the troubles international students face in the UK and associated recommendations, NISAU President Sanam Arora was invited to address the Westminster Higher Education Policy Forum on improving the international student experience in the UK. The very successful address was concluded with the message that "international students need to be at the heart of policy making, not migration targets or vote-bank politics."[20][21] NISAU is coordinating with numerous organizations including UKCISA and the Indian High commission to protect Indian students from landing at bogus UK colleges by creating wide awareness. NISAU believes that "There are no bogus students, only bogus colleges" and is therefore committed to safeguard the interest of such students.[22] NISAU Scotland unit works actively with the Scottish Government in improving the immigration and other concerns Indian students and alumni have while in Scotland. NISAU Scotland has actively contributed in the Scottish Government's initiatives to bring back the Post Study Work Visa for Scotland.[23][24][25] NISAU has collaborated with London and Partners, which runs studylondon.ac.uk to run a first of its kind research project into the experiences of Indian students and alumni in the UK.[26] Cultural Initiatives[edit] Honorary Fellowship[edit] Honorary Fellowship of the National Indian Students and Alumni Union is recognized as the highest honour that can be bestowed onto a non-member by the Union. The individual will have made significant and long-lasting contributions to India, Indian Culture and/or the welfare of Indian students and youth in the UK, or elsewhere. It is awarded in recognition of: (a) distinction in the arts, literature, science, business or public life; or (b) exceptional service to NISAU The NISAU bestowed its first Honorary Fellowships on to two legends of Indian Cinema, Mr Javed Akhtar and Mrs Shabana Azmi, for their exceptional services to Cinema and Society to mark the centenary year of Indian cinema.[27] In 2016 former Chief Election Commissioner of India, Dr S Y Quraishi was awarded the NISAU Honorary Fellowship of the NISAU at an event at the High Commission of India, London. The fellowship was presented on NISAU's behalf by the Deputy High Commissioner of India, Dr Virander Paul. [28] Youth Icon Awards[edit] NISAU has started Youth Icon Award from 2014. The first Youth Icon Award by NISAU was awarded to renowned playback singer Mr. Arijit Singh at a music function held at London O2 for being an inspiration to millions of Indian youngsters worldwide, in the field of music.[29] NISU Talks[edit] NISAU in past has hosted many inspirational personalities including Saif Ali Khan,[30] Dr. Shashi Tharoor,[31] Ranbir Kapoor,[32] Vidhu Vinod Chopra,[33] Deepa Mehta[34] and Kalki Koechlin.[35] Social Initiatives and Partnerships[edit] Solidarity Gathering: The Call for Change[edit] NISAU has a core belief system of supporting and bringing equal opportunities to young people of Indian origin; also helping students who have been the victims of abuse to help them achieve justice. By organizing solidarity gathering under the "The Call for Change" on Friday 25 January 2013 to condemn the Delhi Rape incident of 29 December 2012, NISAU has tried at its level to send a silent message to Indian government and society from UK-based Indian diaspora on declining levels of women safety in India.[36] NISAU and GOPIO[edit] The Global Organization of People of Indian Origin (GOPIO) and NISAU have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to further the objectives of GOPIO and NISAU for the interests of students and youth of the Indian Diaspora, utilizing the outreach and strengths of GOPIO and its Youth Council in collaboration with the initiatives and advocacy of NISAU.[37][37] GOPIO, established in 1989 with headquarters in the United States, is a global non-profit advocacy organization in the service of over 30 million Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) and Persons of Indian Origin (PIOs) living outside of India.[38] GOPIO is the premiere international Indian Diaspora advocacy organization and the network of NRIs and PIOs with chapters and member representation in 26 countries. NISAU and Rang De[edit] NISAU and Rang De UK have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to work together to eliminate poverty in India. The partnership commenced with the 2 organizations delivering phenomenal presentations at the House of Commons. The joint vision is to make poverty history in India by reaching out to underserved communities through microcredit.[39] Rang De is striving to do this through a network of committed field partners and social investors, by offering microcredit that has a positive impact on business, education, health and environment of the communities they work with.[40] NISAU has recognized the value of bringing the Rang De model with PIO and NRI youngsters and has therefore joined hands with Rang De in order to play its part in eliminating poverty from India. NISAU and Paint Our World[edit] In a humanitarian project dedicated to making a positive difference to the lives of underserved children under the The Call For Change initiative, NISAU has partnered with Paint Our World[6] which works to emotionally empower children who have been through trauma – this includes child sexual abuse and becoming orphaned.[41] Soon after joining hands, NISAU supported Paint our World in organising an exhibition titled “EmPOWer: A Life Changing Exhibition in London" from Monday 14 July until Friday 18 July 2014 to celebrate the artwork of the incredible children also marking the first anniversary of Paint our World.[42] See also[edit]  Ministry of Overseas Indian Affairs Rang De Global Organization for People of Indian Origin National Union of Students (United Kingdom) http://www.oifc.in/ https://www.globalink.in/  References[edit]   ^ "NISU".
