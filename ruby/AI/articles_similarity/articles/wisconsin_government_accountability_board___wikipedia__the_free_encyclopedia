(September 2012) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)   The Wisconsin Government Accountability Board is a non-partisan regulatory agency of the State of Wisconsin which administers and enforces Wisconsin law pertaining to campaign finance, elections, ethics and lobbying. The G.A.B. staff also is non-partisan. The agency is organized into two divisions: The Elections Division and the Ethics and Accountability Division.    Contents   1 Composition 2 History 3 References 4 External links    Composition[edit] The Board consists of six members, all former state judges, who serve staggered, six-year terms. Board members are appointed by the Governor, and serve part-time, receiving per diems for each meeting they attend.[1] The Governor of Wisconsin nominates a judge to fill a vacancy from a roster of potential Board members previously selected by a panel of Wisconsin Court of Appeals judges; and the nominee must be confirmed by the Wisconsin State Senate. History[edit] The Board was created in 2008 as the result of the merger of the former State Ethics Board and State Elections Boards.[2] References[edit]   ^ "Members of the Government Accountability Board" State of Wisconsin Government Accountability Board website; accessed September 14, 2012 ^ "About the Government Accountability Board" State of Wisconsin Government Accountability Board website; accessed September 14, 2012   External links[edit]  Official website     This Wisconsin-related article is a stub.
