(August 2009)      (Learn how and when to remove this template message)   The Conference of Addis Ababa was a meeting of the Oriental Orthodox churches in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in January 1965.[1] This meeting was momentous as there has been no such collective meeting of the various Non-Chalcedonian churches since the 17th century. The meeting was attended by Pope Cyril VI (head of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria), Mor Ignatius Ya`qub III (head of the Syriac Orthodox Church), Vazgen I (head of the Armenian Apostolic Church), Khoren I (head of the Armenian Catholicosate of Cilicia), and Baselios Augen I (head of the then-united Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church).
