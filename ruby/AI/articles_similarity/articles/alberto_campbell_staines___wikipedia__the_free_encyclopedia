The family returned to Australia from Jamaica in September 2003 with Campbell entering on a tourist visa after an adoption visa was wrongly denied.[1] The family flew to New Zealand in December 2004 to be granted Alberto’s permanent residency adoption visa.[1] He became an Australian citizen in 2006.[4] The family took the adoption visa case to High Court.[4] In Brisbane, he attended the Citipointe Christian College. In 2015, he works as a Primary Teacher's Assistant at Citipointe Christian College.[4] Athletics career[edit] Campbell became serious about his running at the age of twelve and joined the QE2 Track Club where he was coached by Annette Rice.[1] He competed at the 2011 Australian Junior AWD Championship and finished 1st in the 400m and 2nd in the 100m and 200m in the under20 age group.[1] At the 2012 Australian Open, AWD & Combined Events Championships he was the only sprinter to enter in all three sprint events and the only one to make it to the final in each event.[1] In 2013, he competed at the 9th INAS World Athletics Championships in Prague, Czech Republic where he won bronze medals in the Men's 400m and Men's 4 × 400 m relay. In the 400 m, he ran a personal best time of 49.73 and the Men's 4 × 400 m broke the Australian record.[5] In 2015, at the Queensland Combined Events Championships, he ran 50.45. In March 2015, at the IPC Athletics Grand Prix, which was part of the Queensland Athletics Championships, he won the Men's 400 m Ambulant in 50.28.[6][7] He won the Men's 400 m Ambulant at the 2015 Australian Championships.[8] Competing at the IPC Athletics Grand Prix that was part of the 2015 Italian Championships, he finished second in the Men's 400 m T20.[9] Campbell-Staines has on his bedroom wall Eric Liddell's famous words ""I believe that God made me for a purpose, but He also made me fast. When I run, I feel His pleasure”. After his success at the World Championships, he said ""I worship God when I run. He is the one who made me fast. I always thank him after races, whether I win or lose, I run for God.”[4][5] At the 2015 IPC Athletics World Championships in Doha, he qualified for the final of the Men’s 400m T20 with a time of 51.94 but he did not start in the final.[10] In 2015, he is an Queensland Academy of Sport scholarship holder[11] and is aiming to compete at the 2016 Rio Paralympics where the Men's 400 m T20 is on the athletics program.
