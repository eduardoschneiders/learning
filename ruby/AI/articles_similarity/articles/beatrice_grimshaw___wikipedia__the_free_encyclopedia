She was educated privately, at Victoria College, Belfast, in Caen, France, then Bedford College, London and Queen's College, Belfast and never graduated,[2] though it was later claimed she had been a lecturer in Classics at Bedford Women's College.[3] Her family were members of the Church of Ireland, but she converted to Catholicism after leaving home. She worked for various shipping companies and then as a freelance journalist in Dublin. After contacting Richard J. Mecredy, the proprietor of the Dublin-based Irish Cyclist, in 1891 expressing her interest in cycling and journalism, she became a contributor to the magazine. Two years later she became sub-editor, and then took over the magazine's sister publication, the Social Review, which she edited until 1903.[4] But she had long harboured a desire to see the Pacific, and in 1904 she was engaged by the (London) Daily Graphic to report on the Pacific islands,[2] reportedly sailing around the Pacific islands in her own cutter.[3] She was commissioned to write publicity for Cook Islands, Fiji, Niue, Samoa, and Tonga.[2] In 1907 she sailed to Papua on a commission from The Times and the Sydney Morning Herald,[2] but remained for twenty-seven years, much of the time at Rona Falls.[5] She became a close friend of Sir Hubert Murray and his unofficial publicist. She joined exploration parties and managed plantations, including one with her brother Ramsay.[2] In 1936, in company with brothers Ramsay and Osborne[2] she retired to Kelso, New South Wales, where she remained for the rest of her life.
