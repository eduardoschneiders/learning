Walters and Davis started the school "not necessarily to create young actors and actresses, but with the premise that good speech, self-esteem and confidence were primary goals …".[1] The first class in 1933 had less than twenty-five students and was held in a basement. In the 75 years since its opening, the theatre (now known as The Children's Theatre) has grown tremendously. The theatre has presented over 700 stage productions to more than a quarter of a million children.[2]  "Over 10,000 Montrealers have enjoyed classes at The Children's Theatre since the school was founded in 1933 by Dorothy Davis and Violet Walters. Some have gone onto professional careers in motion pictures, television and the stage. Many have obtained roles in TV and radio commercials both as children and adults."[3]  The ladies ran the school until they were in their 90's. Dorothy Davis died on September 22, 1993.[4] Violet Walters died in September 1994.
