One of the first truly independent (of the Soviet ruling clique influences) newspapers, it was set up in 1991 after a mass exodus of staff from Eesti Ekspress after its Soviet parent company, Cross Development FSP, fired Hans H. Luik.[1] The newspaper was known for its courageous approach to journalism, for example by gathering fame through publishing a list of KGB collaborationist in Estonia.
