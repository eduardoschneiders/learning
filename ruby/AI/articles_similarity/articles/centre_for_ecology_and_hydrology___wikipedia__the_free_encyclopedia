As part of the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), it provides services based on innovative, independent and interdisciplinary science and long-term environmental monitoring, forming an integral part of NERC's strategy. CEH is a member of PEER (the Partnership for European Environmental Research).[1] The Centre for Ecology & Hydrology is one of four environmental research organisations wholly owned by NERC, along with the British Geological Survey, the British Antarctic Survey and the National Oceanography Centre. The single organisation CEH was established in 2000 from the combination of four existing NERC research centres. [1] The Centre operates from four sites across the UK: Wallingford (headquarters), Edinburgh, Lancaster and Bangor. The current director is Mark J. Bailey.[2] Past directors include Pat Nuttall (2001–11).[3] See also[edit]  OpenMI Standard · CEH is the lead organisation for the Open Modelling Interface standard.
