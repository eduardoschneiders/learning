It may be written with either of two different hanja. Those with the name meaning "scenery" (景) may belong to one of two different bon-gwan: Haeju, South Hwanghae, in what is today North Korea, and Taein (泰仁). There is only one bon-gwan for the other Kyung surname, meaning "celebration" (慶): Cheongju, Chungcheongbuk-do, in what is today South Korea.[1] In a study by the National Institute of the Korean Language based on 2007 application data for South Korean passports, it was found that 69.2% of people with this surname spelled it in Latin letters as Kyung in their passports, while another 19.2% spelled it as Kyoung. The Revised Romanisation spelling Gyeong came in third place at 7.6%. Rarer alternative spellings (the remaining 4.0%) included Kyeong.[2] People with the surname Kyung include:  Gyeong Dae-seung (1154–1183), Goryeo Dynasty general Kyung Soo-jin (born 1987), South Korean actress Kyong Wonha (fl. 2000s), North Korean nuclear scientist  In given names[edit] Kyung is an element in many popular Korean given names.
