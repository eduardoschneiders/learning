It was the middle of the night when Connie fell asleep and heard the cue of a very, noisy animal. It was the sound of a very, nocturnal cricket. She has never seen a cricket before, and she ran to the safety of her mom and dad and fell asleep. Every morning she wakes up often and steps out of the shed after her mom and dad. She has lots of friend, like Patch, Wally and Grouch, Paddy and Pearl; whenever at night, she runs off home. The first night outside was when Connie chases a butterfly, and returns home. Her parents howled and mooed at her, for Connie to return. She returns just in time, they go home together, and they fall asleep just in time often. Connie falls asleep happy and contending until the next day. Characters[edit]  Connie - A young female bovine and the protagonist of the series. She is very curious and always tries new things.
