Jamieson, with four goals and four assists, was named Championship Game MVP.[3] A year later, Jamieson won the scoring title and after leading the Knighthawks to their third straight Championship, was named league MVP.[4] Canadian Box career[edit] Junior[edit] During Jamieson's tenure with the Six Nations Arrows Express of the OLA Junior A Lacrosse League, he would help the team to four straight league championships. In 2007, Jamieson would lead an all-star team, which included future NLL players Sid Smith, Shawn Evans and Craig Point, to Six Nations' first Minto Cup national championship in 15 years. Jamieson was also awarded the "Jim McConaghy Memorial Cup" as Series M.V.P.[5] Jamieson had his best season yet the following year. Jamieson would lead the league in scoring with a career high 59 goals and 101 points, and was awarded the "Green Gael Trophy" as league M.V.P. He was also given the "Jim Veltman Award" as the league's Most Outstanding Player.[5] Jamieson finished his outstanding junior career with 199 goals and 395 points, as well as 141 goals and 251 points in the playoffs. He is currently ranked 24th all time in goals (regular season and playoffs combined) in Canadian junior lacrosse history with 340.[6] Senior[edit] Jamieson scored 48 goals and 96 points during his first season of senior lacrosse with the Six Nations Chiefs. Jamieson became the first player in Major Series Lacrosse history to lead the league in scoring, win the Rookie of the Year and the Most Valuable Player awards all in his rookie season.[7] College career[edit] Onondaga Community College[edit] Jamieson began his college career at Onondaga Community College. During his first year, Jamieson led the Lazers (which included fellow Six Nations players Craig Point and Sid Smith) to an 18-0 undefeated season and a national championship. During his first season, Jamieson finished second in league scoring with 57 goals and 121 points. In 2007, Jamieson led the nation in goals (65), assists (51), and points (116) on the way to a second consecutive undefeated season and national championship. In the 2007 championship game, Jamieson scored 9 goals, and was awarded game M.V.P. honours for a second year in a row. He was named an NJCAA first-team All-American and the NJCAA Offensive Player of the Year. Syracuse University[edit] Jamieson transferred to Syracuse in 2008. However, due to academic reasons, Jamieson was not allowed to play until the last few games of the 2009 season. Jamieson played with the Orange during the 2009 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship. Syracuse advanced to the championship game. In sudden death overtime of the championship game, Jamieson scored the game-winning goal to give Syracuse their second national championship in a row.[8][9] He was named to the NCAA championship All-Tournament team after scoring 8 goals in 6 games.
