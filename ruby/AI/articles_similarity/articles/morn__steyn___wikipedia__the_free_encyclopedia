Morné Steyn (born 11 July 1984 in Cape Town) is a South African rugby union player who plays at the Flyhalf position. He plays at number 10 for the Springboks internationally, as well as for Stade Français in the French Top 14 competition. He previously played Super Rugby for the Bulls and was a member of the team that won the 2007, 2009 and 2010 Super Rugby competitions, ending both the 2009 and 2010 seasons as the leading point scorer and setting a record of 4 drop goals in one single match, in the 2009 semi-final against the Crusaders.[2] In May 2013 it was announced that he would join the French Top 14 club, Stade Français.[3] He made his début on Friday 30 August 2013 in a 38 - 3 victory against Biarritz Olympique. Coming on in the 60th minute, he scored 4 points by converting two tries.[4] Steyn has won an U-21 World Cup, 2 Currie Cups, 3 Super rugby titles, 1 Tri-Nations and a French Top 14 title.

Steyn was on the replacement bench during the second Test of the 2009 British and Irish Lions tour to South Africa, when Pienaar's kicking game disintegrated. Steyn made a huge impression when he replaced Pienaar and immediately slotted two conversions and two penalties – including one from 53m out in the dying minutes of the game, which gave the Springboks the match and the series in dramatic fashion. On 1 August 2009 the Springboks won their match versus New Zealand in the 2009 Tri Nations Series in Durban with a score of 31–19. Steyn scored all of South Africa's 31 points (8 penalty kicks and a converted try).[5] This broke quite a few records, amongst them the record for the most points by an individual in a Tri Nations match – previously held by Andrew Mehrtens with his score of 29 against Australia in 1999 (One conversion and nine penalties). During this match Steyn also had one drop goal attempt come off the upright and pushed one more penalty wide of the posts. This was while earning his fifth Test cap and only his second start for the Springboks. Morne Steyn scored the most points by an individual player in the 2011 Rugby World Cup, where he procured 62 points. Records[edit]  World record for most points scored by a player who has scored all their team's points (31). Most points scored against New Zealand (31) in a single test South African record for penalties in a test (8) – beating the seven achieved twice by former fullback and now kicking coach of South Africa, Percy Montgomery.  All of the above records achieved with his 31 points scored in the Tri Nations 2009 match against the All Blacks in Durban on 1 Aug 09[6]   South African record for most points in a test against Australia.

Most points by a Bulls player in Super Rugby history (1,467) Most points by a South African and first South African to reach 1,000 points in Super Rugby (1,467) Steyn also holds the record for most consecutive successful kicks at goal in Test play since statistics for that category were first kept in the late 1980s. He had a streak of 41 successful attempts that ended on 6 November 2010 against Ireland. The previous record was 36, held by Chris Paterson of Scotland.[8][9]  Bulls[edit]  Biggest points margin in a super 14 final (61–17) Biggest win in a Super Rugby match vs the Reds (92-3) The only franchise from South Africa to have won the Super Rugby trophy - and on three occasions  References[edit]   ^ a b "SA Rugby Player Profile – Morné Steyn".
