In that year, it became a principality, which lasted until the fall of the German monarchies in 1918, during the German Revolution of 1918–1919. After the German Revolution, it became a republic. In 1920, it joined with other small states in the area to form the new state of Thuringia. Schwarzburg-Sondershausen had an area of 862 km² and a population of 85,000 (1905). Towns placed in the state were: Arnstadt, Sondershausen, Gehren, Langewiesen, Großbreitenbach, Ebeleben, Großenehrich, Greußen and Plaue.

Prince Sizzo was recognised as a full member of the House of Schwarzburg in 1896. Upon the death of Prince Friedrich Günther, the last in the male line, the headship passed under Semi-Salic primogeniture to his elder sister, Princess Marie Antoinette of Schwarzburg, who married Friedrich Magnus V, Count of Solms-Wildenfels. The House of Schwarzburg subsequently became a personal union with the House of Solms-Wildenfels.[1][self-published source?] [2][unreliable source?]  1918–1925: Prince Günther Victor (1852–1925) 1925–1926: Prince Sizzo (1860–1926) 1926–1971: Prince Friedrich Günther (1901–1971) 1971-1984: Princess Marie Antoinette of Schwarzburg 1984: Friedrich Magnus VI, Prince of Schwarzburg, Count of Solms-Wildenfels  Villages with more than 2000 people[edit]   Village Inhabitants December 1, 1910   Arnstadt 17,841   Sondershausen 7759   Langewiesen 3814   Greußen 3348   Großbreitenbach 3255   Gehren 2917   Geschwenda 2291   See also[edit]  House of Schwarzburg  References[edit]   ^ The House of Schwarzburg on Heraldica.org ^ James, John Almanach de Gotha, Volume I, 2013.
