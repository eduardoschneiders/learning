The Corporate Town of Port Augusta West was gazetted on 6 October 1887,[10] and only merged into the Corporate Town of Port Augusta on 28 April 1932. The bridge across the head of Spencer Gulf connecting Port Augusta West to Port Augusta was built in 1926, replacing a punt.[11] Port Augusta West contains the junction of the Eyre Highway (to Eyre Peninsula and Western Australia), Stuart Highway (to the Far North and Northern Territory), and Augusta Highway (to Adelaide).

It is dissected by the following major highways - the Augusta Highway which branches in the middle of the suburb to become the Stuart Highway which heads north and the Eyre Highway which heads south. The Whyalla-Port Augusta railway line passes to the north and west of the suburb’s urban area.[12][13] The majority land use is residential which accounts for most of the built development on the eastern side of the suburb. The area between the Eyre Highway and the Stuart highway on the west side of the suburb’s built area is zoned for industrial use. The Port Augusta Airport is located to the south end of the suburb and is separated from the residential area by open space and a “vegetation buffer”.[14] The suburb also includes the following facilities - the Port Augusta Golf Club and the Port Augusta West Primary School[12][15][16] The suburb also includes the following public parks and gardens - the Australian Arid Lands Botanic Garden, the West Side Foreshore, the Westside Lookout Tower, the Rotary Park, the Northey Crescent and the Sid Welk Park.[17] [18][19][20][21][22] History[edit] The historic Port Augusta West Water Tower in Mitchell Terrace is listed on the South Australian Heritage Register.[23] Governance[edit] Port Augusta West is located within the federal division of Grey, the state electoral district of Stuart, and the local government area of the City of Port Augusta.[6][5][2] The suburb is also located within the South Australian Government region of the Far North.[24] Climate[edit] Port Augusta West has a warm desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWk).[25]   Climate data for Port Augusta Airport, Port Augusta West   Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year   Average high °C (°F) 34.3 (93.7) 33.3 (91.9) 30.3 (86.5) 26.6 (79.9) 21.7 (71.1) 18 (64) 17.7 (63.9) 20.1 (68.2) 24.1 (75.4) 26.9 (80.4) 30.4 (86.7) 31.9 (89.4) 26.3 (79.3)   Average low °C (°F) 19.4 (66.9) 18.9 (66) 16.4 (61.5) 12.9 (55.2) 8.8 (47.8) 6.2 (43.2) 4.7 (40.5) 5.3 (41.5) 8.5 (47.3) 11.5 (52.7) 15.6 (60.1) 17 (63) 12 (54)   Average precipitation mm (inches) 12.4 (0.488) 18.4 (0.724) 17 (0.67) 18.9 (0.744) 15.4 (0.606) 24.7 (0.972) 18.2 (0.717) 14.6 (0.575) 17.4 (0.685) 16.5 (0.65) 20.6 (0.811) 23.9 (0.941) 217.6 (8.567)   Source: Bureau of Meteorology[4]   See also[edit]  List of cities and towns in South Australia  References[edit]   ^ "2011 Census QuickStats - Port Augusta West Code SSC40584 (SSC)".
