          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                            Jump to:     navigation,      search          Tigris.org is an open source software development community. It hosts software development services such as web hosting, mailing lists, issue tracking, wiki, download, and revision control with Subversion or Concurrent Versions System (GNU CVS). It is hosted by CollabNet, the initiators and stewards of Subversion, and runs CollabNet Enterprise Edition. Portions of the Subversion project itself are hosted on Tigris. Tigris competes with the better-known SourceForge, although it is primarily focused on projects for collaborative software development. Since July 2014, tigris.org does not accept new project proposals.[1] See also[edit]     Free software portal     CollabNet GForge JavaForge Subversion Comparison of open source software hosting facilities  References[edit]   ^ "wayback machine, tigris.org homepage".
