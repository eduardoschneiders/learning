Bush's administration had placed on the field of stem-cell research, slowing the pace of research.[7] Scientists who were leaders in their fields are prohibited from using funding from the National Institutes of Health to conduct certain experiments that could provide significant medical achievements.[8] In March 2015, scientists, including an inventor of CRISPR, urged a worldwide moratorium on germline gene therapy, writing "scientists should avoid even attempting, in lax jurisdictions, germline genome modification for clinical application in humans" until the full implications "are discussed among scientific and governmental organizations".[9][10][11][12] After the publication that a Chinese group had used CRISPR to modify a gene in human embryos, the group repeated their call for a moratorium on “attempts at human clinical germ-line genome editing while extensive scientific analysis of the potential risks is conducted, along with broad public discussion of the societal and ethical implications.”[13] References[edit]  ^ a b "International Society for Stem Cell Research, Inc."
