Born and raised in Bangor, Maine, Costello specialized in nautical fiction, but made at least one early contribution to the genre later called prehistoric fiction with his Sure-Dart of 1909. His books were normally pitched to a young adult audience. Costello's 'day-job', at which he worked for 30 years, was as Bangor manager for the national credit-reporting firm R.G. Dunn.[1] His known novel-length works include:  Master Ardick: Buccaneer (New York: D. Appleton, 1896; reprinted 1906) On Fighting Decks in 1812 (Boston: Dana Estes, 1899) A Tar of the Old School (Boston: Dana Estes, 1900) Nelson's Yankee Boy: The Adventures of a Plucky Young New Englander at Trafalgar and Elsewhere, and Later in the War of 1812 (Holt, 1904) Sure-Dart: A Story of Strange Hunters and Stranger Game in the Days of Monsters (Chicago: A.C. McClurg & Co., 1909) The Girl with Two Selves (Chicago: A.C. McClurg & Co.,1913) Morgan's Youngest Rifleman (Laird & Lee, 1913) Under the Rattlesnake Flag  The Boston Globe reported in 1910 that Costello owned a talking crow, who could say 'papa', 'mama', 'what' and "a number of other short words".[2] References[edit]  ^ Sprague's Journal of Maine History, v. 7-9 (1919), p. 194 ^ Boston Globe, Dec. 1, 1910, p. 20  External links[edit]  Works by or about Frederick H.
