The show, which is hosted by well known college and National Football League television analyst Charles Davis, takes its viewers across the country in search of the brightest young stars in sports.[1] Sports Stars of Tomorrow is the only high-school sports program in national syndication.[2] The show began in 2005 and provides in-depth feature stories about the top prep athletes in the United States. The goal of the program is to get an “off the field” look at the athletes, so they are frequently shown doing things like playing golf, strumming guitars, and studying. It is produced by GameDay Productions, a private television production company based in Fort Worth, Texas. When the show began in the fall of 2005 it reached out to just 20 percent of the country. Currently, it is airing in over 90 percent of all homes nationwide and can be seen in markets such as New York City (WABC-TV), Washington D.C. (WTTG), Chicago (WFLD), and Dallas-Fort Worth (KDFW).[3] Stories covered[edit] SST looks to answer these types of viewer's questions:  Who will be the young superstar leading his team to an NBS title in five years? Which young quarterback will be the Super Bowl MVP in 2022? What names should we look for in the next generation of superstar athletes?[4]  Nine of the top 15 picks in the 2008 NBA Draft were previously featured on the program. Other prominent athletes that have been featured on the show are: Tim Tebow, Chris Wells, Kevin Durant, Derrick Rose, Michael Beasley, Andrew Luck and Matt Barkley. Hosts[edit] Charles Davis (2012–present) has worked as an analyst with FOX Sports since 2007. He has also served as an analyst with the Big Ten Network, TBS, CBS, ESPN, The Golf Channel, TNT, and Sun Sports Network, while also working as a color analyst for Arena Football League telecasts on NBC Sports (2003–2005) and NFL Network. Pat Summerall (2005–2012) began his broadcasting career in 1962 after playing ten seasons in the NFL. He worked for CBS until 1994, when Summerall joined Fox as the network's lead play-by-play voice for NFL coverage, teaming with John Madden on both occasions. In 1999, Summerall was inducted into the American Sportscasters Association Hall of Fame. He has also been given the Pro Football Hall of Fame's Pete Rozelle Radio-Television Award as well as the Lifetime Achievement Award for Sports from the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. Summerall died on April 16, 2013, at the age of 82, just 24 days shy of his 83rd birthday. References[edit]   ^ (2012. Charles Davis is the new host of Sports Stars of Tomorrow. ^ Pursell, C.
