These games range in the style of the collaboration from games that consult with a single indigenous person to games that are entirely developed and designed by indigenous people.[1]  7 Generation Games (Spirit Lake [2013], Fish Lake [2015], Forgotten Trail [2015], Aztech Games [forthcoming])[10] Aboriginal Peoples Television Network (Animism [2010] Mawisowin [2012], and Your Mix)[11] Arviat Code Club (Multiple scratch games [2014-2015])[12] Black Cherry Digital Productions (Path of the Elders [2010] in partnership between the Mushkegowuk Cree, Carlton University, and Pinegrove Productions)[13] DarianJ (Sleep Guardian [2015])[14] Elizabeth LaPensée (Techno Medicine Wheel [2008], Max's Adventures [2013], Gathering Native Foods [2014] in collaboration with Hibulb Cultural Center, Invaders [2015] with art by Steven Paul Judd and music by Trevino Brings Plenty, Ninagamomin ji-nanaandawi'iwe (We Sing for Healing) [2015])[11] Green Circle Productions (Manidoonsug: Little Spirits [forthcoming] in consultation with Mississauga New Credit and Annishinabe groups around the GTA[4] Minority Media (Spirits of Spring [2014])[15] Ogoki (Multiple Language Apps [2012-2015], Babaamosedaa Let's Go for a Walk [2014], Brokenhead Bingo [2015], and Rez Bomb [2015])[16] Pinnguaq (Singuistics [2013] in collaboration with Elizabeth LaPensée, Art Alive [2015], Qalupalik [forthcoming])[17] Raindrop Games (Arrival: Village Kasike [2012] partnered with Roberto Mukaro Borrero and the United Confederation of Taino People[18] Revolve (Music Mogul [2014] with extensive content by indigenous musicians including A Tribe Called Red, Elisapie, Joey Stylez, Madeskimo, and Red City[19] Skins Workshops (Otsì:!
