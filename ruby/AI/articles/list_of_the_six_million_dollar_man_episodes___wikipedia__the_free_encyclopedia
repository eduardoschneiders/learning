In a test flight accident caused by a malfunctioning center stick, his right arm is severed, his left eye is blinded, and both legs must be surgically amputated. Steve Austin’s personal physician, Dr. Rudy Wells, has theorized about the creation of a cyborg through the installation of bionic parts. He is persuaded by an OSO agent to reconstruct his patient/friend with the understanding that Steve Austin will subsequently work for the OSO. Dr. Wells apprises Steve of the plan, but is met with much resistance as Steve Austin mentally struggles to cope with his injuries, the installation of artificial components, and the future obligations that will be involuntarily thrust upon him. Following surgery and lengthy rehabilitation, Steve Austin reluctantly accepts an assignment to rescue a hostage in Saudi Arabia. Guest Star: Martin Balsam as the first Dr. Rudy Wells   2 Wine, Women and War Russ Mayberry Glen A. Larson October 20, 1973    Steve Austin is gravely injured by a depth charge while fleeing from a failed mission in Egypt. He refuses further cooperation with OSI which will not disclose to him the target of the operation which nearly cost him his life. OSI conspires with an old Air Force acquaintance to dupe Steve Austin into “escaping” from his involuntary confinement to Paradise Cay in the Bahamas. There he is unwittingly thrust back into the same operation which intends to stop an arms dealer named Findletter from selling stolen American and Russian nuclear missiles. The stakes are increased when Findletter attempts to hijack a newly launched American submarine. Guest Star: Britt Ekland as a Russian agent. Bionic Powers Revealed: Steve Austin’s bionic eye has night vision. It is both suggested and partially contradicted that Steve Austin's bionics give him the ability to hold his breath for long periods of time. Noteworthy Moments: This episode features bionic swimming and deep-sea fishing. The character of Oscar Goldman is introduced. Alan Oppenheimer debuts as the second Dr. Rudy Wells. The sound effect later used to indicate the operation of Steve Austin's eye is heard here as the button effect that operates the missile bay doors. Steve Austin purposely rigs a nuclear bomb to be unwittingly detonated by his pursuer in an inhabited part of Paradise Cay. The bomb is detonated as he looks on from what is portrayed to be a safe distance. Steve Austin threatens his Air Force friend with kicking him as “high as Skylab.” Early 1970s tolerance for sexual innuendo is demonstrated when, following an offscreen romantic interlude at sea and the destruction of a boat wall with a window, Austin tells his tied-up tootsie that he is “sorry for violating your porthole.”   3 The Solid Gold Kidnapping Russ Mayberry Larry Alexander, Alan Caillou November 17, 1973   Oscar Goldman orchestrates a ruse whereby a high level U.S. military diplomat pretending to be holed up in a Paris hospital is to be secretly whisked off to Peking to negotiate an ease of tensions between the two countries. A professional kidnapping organization successfully abducts the diplomat in Paris with the aid of his treacherous paramour known as the Contessa. The kidnappers demand a $1 billion ransom in gold. As the gold shipment moves forward, Steve Austin begins a search against the clock for the hostage. He is aided both by the fickle Contessa and by a doctor who agrees, with perilous consequences, to have brain cells of a dead kidnapper injected into her own brain to allow her to have access to his memories.   Some sources consider these movies to be part of Season 1 of the series, particularly the second and third films, which aired only a couple of months before the weekly series began. All three films were later re-edited into two-part episodes of the regular series, with additional footage added, for the purposes of network reruns and later syndication. In all three cases, the original opening credits are removed and replaced with the standard Six Million Dollar Man opening credits. In the case of "The Moon and the Desert", some of the additional footage consisted of clips from later seasons, including footage of Martin E. Brooks as Rudy Wells, even though Martin Balsam plays the character in the first telefilm, and operation footage from "The Bionic Woman" episode of season 2.
