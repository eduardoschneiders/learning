The school mascot is the Lakers. Minnewaska is a member of the West Central Conference. The Minnewaska Area School District #2149 was consolidated in 1993 from three Pope County districts: Glenwood/Lowry, Starbuck, and Villard. Consolidation came after several years of cooperation that resulted in the building of the Minnewaska Area High School in 1991 that now serves about ¾ of the county. The Minnewaska Area High School was constructed at a cost of $16,500,000, funded partially with a $6,000,000 grant from the State of Minnesota.[1] Notes[edit]   ^ http://www.minnewaska.k12.mn.us/District/District%20Index.htm   External links[edit]  Minnewaska Area High School homepage                     Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Minnewaska_Area_High_School&oldid=703810424"          Categories: Public high schools in MinnesotaHidden categories: Articles needing additional references from January 2014All articles needing additional referencesCoordinates on WikidataPages using infobox school with unsupported parameters
