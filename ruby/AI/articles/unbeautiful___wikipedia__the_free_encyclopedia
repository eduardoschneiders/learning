She started promoting her first single and she did live performances. She performed on The Today Show and The Early Show. Album[edit] The album, titled "Unbeautiful" was released on September 30, 2008. It peaked on Billboard's Top Heatseekers chart at #5.[4] She described the meaning of the album's name, "Unbeautiful" as the title of one of her favorite songs on the album; "I called the album that because it’s when I hit rock bottom. It’s the question a lot of people ask when they’re in a relationship, and it’s like ‘where was the point where you didn’t find me attractive anymore?’ It’s a universal feeling and an unusual word. A lot of people ask me about it and relate to it. And the world is not perfect right now. "Unbeautiful" seems like a realistic title for a lot of things that are happening" Track listing[edit]  "I'm Gone, I'm Going" (L. Roy, M. Martin, J. Schuster, A. Kronlund) "Here for You Now" (L.
