Alvarado to Francis Ziba Branch.[1] The grant encompassed present-day Arroyo Grande.[2][3] History[edit] Francis Ziba Branch (1802 - 1874) came over land to California with Wolfskill party in 1831. In 1835 he married María Manuela Carlón, and in 1837, Governor Alvarado granted Branch, Rancho Santa Manuela.[4] With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican-American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored. As required by the Land Act of 1851, a claim for Rancho Santa Manuela was filed with the Public Land Commission in 1852,[5] and the grant was patented to Francis Ziba Branch in 1868.[6] The Branch family lived on the land until 1879, when much of Rancho Santa Manuela was sold to Philip Biddle and his son John Biddle (1840-1891).[7] See also[edit]  Ranchos of California List of Ranchos of California  References[edit]   ^ Ogden Hoffman, 1862, Reports of Land Cases Determined in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Numa Hubert, San Francisco ^ Diseño del Rancho Santa Manuela ^ San Luis Obispo Mexican Land Grants ^ Hoover, Mildred B.; Rensch, Hero; Rensch, Ethel; Abeloe, William N.
