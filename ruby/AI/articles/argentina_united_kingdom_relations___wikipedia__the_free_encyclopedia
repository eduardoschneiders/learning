Both countries established diplomatic relations on December 15, 1823. Diplomatic relations were cut off before the Falklands War (1982) and they were reinstated in 1990. Post-war relations between the two countries improved significantly up until the mid-2000s. During the government of Cristina Kirchner relations they became increasingly tense, with both countries reasserting their claims to the Falkland Islands. In 2016 British Prime Minister David Cameron and Argentine President Mauricio Macri held a meeting where they agreed to begin a new stage of dialogue and friendship between the two countries and reaffirming the strong relationship the two countries have historically.[1] Argentina has an embassy in London and the United Kingdom has an embassy in Buenos Aires. The current British Ambassador to Argentina is John Freeman. The current Argentine Ambassador to the United Kingdom is Renato Carlos Sersale di Cerisano.

The modern territory of Argentina was initially part of the Spanish Empire. The Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute was initially a dispute of Spain and Britain, with events such as the Falklands Crisis of 1770. Spain allied with France against Britain during the Napoleonic Wars, so Britain launched the British invasions of the Río de la Plata. The first British attack invaded Buenos Aires, the city was liberated by Santiago de Liniers with forces from Montevideo. A second attack invaded Montevideo, but failed to invade Buenos Aires a second time, and Montevideo was returned to Spain during the surrender. France attacked Spain (starting the Peninsular War in Europe) and Spain allied with Britain, so the British made no further attacks at the Río de la Plata. The Peninsular War, the social changes caused by the huge militarization of the people of Buenos Aires and other local and international influences led to the May Revolution, which began the Argentine War of Independence. Britain stayed neutral during the conflict, and accepted the Argentine Declaration of Independence on December 15, 1823. The formal relations were established with the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation Between Argentina and the United Kingdom. During the National Organization period, Argentina began to outline a foreign policy favoring relations with Britain, which became the main buyer of Argentine raw materials and the major source of investment in the country. In 1865, during the Liberal government of Bartolome Mitre, and tested British involvement1 conducted the Paraguayan War of Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil against the Republic of Paraguay. During the government of Nicolas Avellaneda, the Conquest of the Desert, 1879 he favored the establishment, in the new conquered lands, immigrant settlers, and dissemination of railroads of British capital, and cattle and sheep raising. Product of a series of geographical expeditions to Patagonia, the Strait of Magellan and Tierra del Fuego made by the Argentine explorer Francisco Pascasio Moreno and Chilean expert Diego Barros Arana between 1873 and 1879, Argentina in 1881 signed the Treaty of limits with Chile. In 1896, problems with the demarcation, the decision had to undergo an arbitration award in Britain. At that time, Moreno was appointed expert on behalf of the Argentine government. In a gesture of brotherhood, February 15, 1899 was found in the Strait of Magellan, Argentine President Julio Argentino Roca and Chilean President Federico Errazuriz Echaurren, in what became known as the "Embrace of the Straits". Finally, the British award was ratified by the General Treaty of Arbitration of 1902 signed in Santiago by Acting Foreign Minister Jose A. Terry, who was criticized on the home front because of the concessions that the country did to Chile and because subjected to perpetual conflict resolution between the two countries to the British crown. In 1902, the Chancellor of the second government of Julio Argentino Roca, Dr. Luis María Drago, had an outstanding performance defending Latin American sovereignty against the sea blockade against Venezuela exercised by Britain, Germany and Italy as punishment for debts that Venezuela had with those countries, and that the president Cipriano Castro refused to pay. The May 1, 1933 was signed the Roca–Runciman Treaty. It was a trade agreement Avoidance in Argentina the effects of a pro-Commonwealth countries, in exchange for lower taxes for imported products from the UK British trade policy. It was signed by Vice President of Argentina, Julio Argentino Pascual Roca -a request of the president Agustín Pedro Justo and Walter Runciman. Falklands War[edit] Main article: Falklands War On April 2, 1982, Argentina under President Leopoldo Galtieri launched an invasion of the Falkland Islands and on April 3, 1982 this was followed by the Argentine invasion of the South Georgia Island.[9] This resulted in the British deploying forces to the Falkland Islands to fight in the Falklands War. Today, despite the British victory in the Falklands War, and a 2013 referendum of the islanders that resulted in a >99% majority in favour of remaining a British Overseas Territory, Argentina still maintains its claims to the Falkland Islands. Post-war relations[edit] Diplomatic relations between the two countries were reinstated in 1990 after the departure of Margaret Thatcher from the post of Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Argentina now has an embassy in London and the United Kingdom has an embassy in Buenos Aires. Relations improved further in the 1990s between the UK and Argentina. In 1998, Carlos Menem, the President of Argentina visited London, where he reaffirmed his country's claims to the Islands, although he stated that Argentina would use only peaceful means to obtain them. In 2001, Tony Blair, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom visited Argentina where he stated that he hoped the UK and Argentina could resolve their differences that led to the 1982 war. However, no talks on sovereignty took place during the visit and Argentina's President Néstor Kirchner stated that he regarded gaining sovereignty over the islands as a 'top priority' of his government.[10] Modern times[edit]      Embassy of the United Kingdom, Buenos Aires.      Embassy of Argentina, London      Since the mid-2000s, diplomatic relations between the UK and Argentina have become increasingly strained. In 2006, Argentina renewed claims to the Falkland Islands, citing concern over fishing and petroleum rights.[11] On 28 March 2009, UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown stated that there was “nothing to discuss” with Cristina Kirchner, the Argentine president, over sovereignty of the islands, when they met in Chile on his pre-2009 G-20 London Summit world tour.[12] On 22 April 2009 Argentina made a formal claim to the UN to an area of the continental shelf encompassing the Falklands, South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands, and parts of Antarctica, citing 11 years worth of maritime survey data.[13] The UK quickly protested these claims.[14] Since 2010, reports of British oil exploration around the Falkland Islands have caused a further downturn in UK-Argentine relations.[15] In February 2010 the Argentine government announced that ships travelling to the Falklands (as well as South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands) would require a permit to use Argentine territorial waters. Despite the new restrictions, Desire Petroleum began drilling for oil on 22 February 2010, about 54 nautical miles (100 km, 62 mi) north of the Islands.[16] Governments of South American countries have generally shown support for Argentina over the Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute in recent years. This is in contrast to the Falklands War when Britain was supported by Chile. In 2011 the Mercosur bloc agreed to close ports to ships flying the Falkland Islands flags, while British-flagged ships would continue to be allowed.[17] The Unasur group of nations has asked the United Kingdom to pursue negotiations over the islands' sovereignty.[18] On 19 March 2012, Peru announced that it was cancelling a visit by the Royal Navy frigate HMS "Montrose" in support of Argentina's claim to the islands.[18]     Former President Cristina Kirchner and former Prime Minister Gordon Brown in 2009.   At the G20 Summit in Mexico in June 2012, British Prime Minister David Cameron and Argentine President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner met unexpectedly in a corridor on the fringes of the G20 Summit and exchanged, at least in diplomatic terms, some rather heated words. Prime Minister Cameron told President Kirchner that she should "respect the views" of Falkland residents, who had announced the 2013 referendum, on the issue of future sovereignty of the island. President Kirchner then attempted to hand an envelope to the Prime Minister but he refused to accept it.[19] In March 2013 the Falkland Islanders voted overwhelmingly in a referendum for the territory to remain British. 1513 to 3, 99.8% in favor of British control. Argentina dismissed the Falkland Islands' sovereignty referendum.[20][21] The UK Government urged Argentina and other countries to respect the islanders' wishes.[22] On the 33rd anniversary of the invasion of the islands on the 2nd of April 2015 Premier Oil, Rockhopper Exploration and Falkland Oil & Gas announced that they had found oil and gas in an offshore field to the north of the islands. On the 3 April 2015 the Argentine Government announced that it was preparing to take legal action against the United Kingdom and the companies involved in oil exploration around the islands without Argentina's permission.[23] On the 8th April 2015 Argentina officially condemned British plans to boost Britain's military presence on the Falklands and that it would be pressing criminal charges against companies conducting oil and gas exploration in the islands.[24] Twinnings[edit]   Esquel, Chubut Province and  Aberystwyth, Ceredigion  La Plata, Buenos Aires Province and  Liverpool, Merseyside  Puerto Madryn, Chubut Province and  Nefyn, Gwynedd  Tres de Febrero, Buenos Aires Province and  Folkestone, Kent  Trelew, Chubut Province and  Caernarfon, Gwynedd  Cultural relations[edit] According to the 2001 UK Census, some 3,932 Argentine-born people were living in the UK.[25] Between 1997 and 2008, 1,062 Argentines acquired British citizenship. There is a strong British cultural influence in Argentina and a large Argentine-British community around Buenos Aires. There is also a strong Welsh-speaking Argentine-Welsh community in Chubut, Patagonia. Of the 25,000 Welsh speakers in Argentina,[26] 5,000 live in the Chubut region,[27] particularly in the original Welsh settlements of Trelew and Trevelin.
