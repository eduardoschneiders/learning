Shortly after, he moved to the A.S. Ramat HaSharon youth team where he demonstrated a good playmaking ability. His ability caught the eyes of basketball giant Maccabi Tel Aviv, where he moved at the age of 17, and subsequently won the 2005–06 Israeli Youth League. College career[edit] Mekel played college basketball for two years at Wichita State.[3] In his rookie season (2006–07), by mid-season he was promoted to starter. He finished his first season with averages of 13 minutes and four points per game. In the 2007–08 season, Mekel improved his stats to 9.3 ppg and 3.7 apg while playing more than 30 minutes per game. Despite his improvement he decided to leave the team after that season.

In Galil, he averaged 6.9 points and 2.7 assists per game. He excelled in the league quarter-finals against Hapoel Holon, helping his team reach the Final Four where they lost to Maccabi Tel Aviv. Mekel ended up winning the best newcomer award.[7] Return to Tel Aviv[edit] After a good season with Galil, Mekel returned to Maccabi Tel Aviv. They designated him the point guard substitute spot, behind newcomer Doron Perkins who won the Israeli league MVP award the previous season.[8] Mekel recorded 13 points and 5 assists in his debut game with Maccabi Tel Aviv against Ironi Nahariya, in the second round of the 2009–10 Israeli League.[9] In December 2009, he asked to be loaned out again after the minority of minutes he was receiving. Return to Galil[edit] Mekel was loaned back to Gilboa/Galil, just 6 months after he finished his first loan to the same team.[10] In Galil, Mekel shared the point guard position with Jeremy Pargo. Together, they led Galil to their second Israeli league title after surprising Maccabi in the final. Mekel was a key member in the team averaging 7.5 points and 4.3 assists in 25.5 minutes per game. In 2010, Mekel got offers from Bnei HaSharon and Maccabi Haifa, but decided to stay in Galil, signing a one-year contract.[11] He played with the team in the Euroleague 2010–11 qualifying rounds, but didn't help the team to pass the first round, where they were eliminated by KK Hemofarm from Serbia. On domestic level, Mekel led Galil to the 2nd place at the end of the regular season. They went all the way to repeat last season final against Maccabi, but this time they lost. Mekel also had a great individual season which concluded in winning the Israeli League MVP Award,[12] and appearing in the 2011 BSL All-Star Game. Benetton Treviso[edit] On July 5, 2011, Mekel signed a two-year contract with Italian team Benetton Treviso.[13] With Benetton, he reached the 2011–12 Eurocup Last 16, and finished 11th in the 2011–12 Serie A. He averaged 6.3 points and 3.7 assists on domestic and 4 points with 2 assists on international stage. At the end of the season, the club dissolved due to financial debts. Maccabi Haifa[edit] At the start of the 2012–13 season, Mekel wanted to stay in Europe but also had tryouts with the Utah Jazz,[14] however after not receiving a sufficient offer, he agreed terms with Maccabi Haifa.[15] Mekel led the team to the 2nd place in the end of the regular season, and to the cup final where they lost to Maccabi Tel Aviv. Haifa got another chance at a title when they reached the league's final which has been held in their home court Romema Arena. The Greens went on to win the match and the championship after a great performance from Mekel: 21 points and 7 assists[16] after he received the Israeli League MVP award which he won a night before.[17] Dallas Mavericks[edit] On July 11, 2013, the Dallas Mavericks signed Mekel to a three-year minimum fully guaranteed contract, and he became the second Israeli to join the NBA.[18][19] Mekel played with the Mavericks in the 2013 NBA Summer League, and finished with averages of 9.7 points and 5 assists per game.[20] In his debut regular season game for the Mavs on October 30, 2013, Mekel recorded 2 points, 2 rebounds, and 3 assists in a 118–109 win over the Atlanta Hawks.[21] Two Israeli players played on opposing NBA teams for the first time on November 1 when Mekel and the Mavericks played Omri Casspi and the Rockets. The two had been teammates on the Israeli Under-16, Under-18, and Under-20 teams, and on the Maccabi Tel Aviv junior team.[22][23] In that game, the Houston Rockets beat the Dallas Mavericks 113-105 in Houston. Casspi scored 12 points in 21 minutes, and Mekel scored 11 points and dished off 6 assists in 23 minutes in his best NBA game to date. On November 30, he started in his first NBA game against the Minnesota Timberwolves and scored 6 points and dished off 7 assists in 26 minutes. The Mavs lost that game though, 106-112. After the game on January 13, 2014, Mekel was placed on the injured list due to a torn meniscus in his right knee, which required surgery and at least 4–6 weeks of recovery.[24] On March 4, 2014, Mekel was assigned to the Texas Legends of the NBA D-League.[25] On March 9, he was recalled by the Mavericks.[26] On March 15, he was reassigned to the Legends.[27] He was recalled three days later. On October 29, 2014, Mekel was waived by the Mavericks.[28] New Orleans Pelicans[edit] On December 5, 2014, Mekel signed a two-year, non-guaranteed contract with the New Orleans Pelicans.[29][30] However, he was later waived by the Pelicans on December 19 after appearing in just four games.[31] Nizhny Novgorod[edit] On February 24, 2015, Mekel moved to Russia and signed with Nizhny Novgorod until the end of the 2015–16 season.[32] Nizhny Novgorod's 2014–15 VTB United League season was ended after being eliminated by CSKA Moscow 3–0 in their semi-final series. In July 2015, he parted ways with Nizhny.[33] Crvena zvezda[edit] On August 27, 2015, Mekel signed a one-year contract with Serbian team Crvena zvezda.[34] Career statistics[edit]   Legend     GP Games played   GS  Games started  MPG  Minutes per game    FG%  Field-goal percentage  3P%  3-point field-goal percentage  FT%  Free-throw percentage    RPG  Rebounds per game  APG  Assists per game  SPG  Steals per game    BPG  Blocks per game  PPG  Points per game  PIR  Performance Index Rating    Bold  Career high   Note: The Euroleague is not the only competition in which the player participated for the team during the season.
