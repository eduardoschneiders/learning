In their fifth year, 1977-78, they won the league championship for the first time, repeating as champions the next season. In the 1980s and 90s the Cubs became a sort of junior hockey dynasty, winning the league championship again in 1980-81, 85-86, 87-88, 90-91, 91-92, 92-93, 94-95, 95-96, 99-00 and 00-01. In this time two Cubs players went on to play in the National Hockey League (Blaine Lacher and Murray Craven) Since the 2001 season the Cubs have more or less struggled compared to former seasons, including some highly rough recent years.[1] The Cubs took a mid-season leave of absence in January 2016 after deciding not to finish out the 2015–16 season with too few players.[2] Recent season-by-season record[edit] (accurate as of the 2014-15 season)[3]   Season GP W L OTL T Pts Finish Playoffs   2002-03 36 25 7 3 1 54 3rd, South N/A   2003-04 35 21 10 3 1 46 2nd, South N/A   2004-05 38 26 11 0 1 53 3rd, South Won League, Bronze at Keystone Cup   2005-06 38 17 17 3 1 38 4th, South Lost Division final (Bisons)   2006-07 36 23 7 5 1 52 2nd, South Lost Division Final (Bisons)   2007-08 36 26 8 0 2 54 2nd, South Lost Division final (Generals)   2008-09 36 16 15 4 1 37 5th, South Lost Division final (Generals)   2009-10 36 24 11 1 0 49 2nd, South Lost Division final (Bisons)   2010-11 36 10 24 0 2 22 5th, South Did not qualify   2011-12 38 14 21 2 1 31 6th, South Did not qualify   2012-13 38 23 10 1 4 51 3rd, South Lost Division final (Bisons)   2013-14 36 16 16 0 4 36 5th, South Lost in Survivor Series   2014-15 38 19 17 0 2 40 4th, South Lost in Survivor Series   2015-16 38 5 33 0 0 10 7th, South Did not qualify   Retired numbers[edit]  1 - Blaine Lacher 9 - Murray Craven 12 - Justin Bremer  See also[edit]  List of ice hockey teams in Alberta  References[edit]   ^ "Cubs president not going to bail | Medicine Hat News".
