Terz guitar (Terz meaning third) refers to either a small sized classical guitar or to the practice of tuning a standard guitar a minor third higher than standard guitar tuning (as though a capo were on the third fret of the guitar). The scale length is generally 530 mm (20.8 inches), though sometimes as long as 560 mm (22 inches). Mauro Giuliani and Caspar Joseph Mertz wrote extensively for the terz guitar as a complement to the prime (standard) guitar. Acceptable alternate spellings for terz include tierce, third, and tertz. Strings makers now produce strings that allow terz guitar tuning on standard scale length guitars at normal string tension.[1] Sources[edit]   ^ Schneider, John (1985): The Contemporary Guitar, p. 157; ISBN 0-520-04048-1.           v t e   Guitar tunings             General          Standard DADGAD Nashville                  Open (Slide and slack-key guitar)               Tuning Repetitive Overtones Other (often most popular)         Open A Open B Open C Open D Open E Open F Open G       A-C♯-E-A-C♯-E B-D♯-F♯-B-D♯-F♯ C-E-G-C-E-G D-F♯-A-D-F♯-A E-G♯-B-E-G♯-B F-A-C-F-A-C G-B-D-G-B-D       A-A-E-A-C♯-E B-B-F♯-B-D♯-F♯ C-C-G-C-E-G D-D-A-D-F♯-A E-E-B-E-G♯-B F-F-C-F-A-C G-G-D-G-B-D       E-A-C♯-E-A-E B-F♯-B-F♯-B-D♯ C-G-C-G-C-E D-A-D-F♯-A-D E-B-E-G♯-B-E C-F-C-F-A-F D-G-D-G-B-D                         Downtuned          E♭ D D♭ C B B♭                  Dropped          Drop D Double drop D Drop C Drop B Drop A                  Regular (semitones)          Unison (0) Minor thirds (3) Major thirds (4) All fourths (5) Augmented fourths (6) New standard (74, 3) All fifths (7)                  Repetitive (open pitches)          Trivial (1) Augmented fourths (2) Major thirds (3) English open-C (3) Russian open-G (3) Minor thirds (4)                  Miscellaneous          Terz Bass guitar Steel guitar (C6, E9) Other instruments Musical tuning William Sethares             List * Category                          Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Terz_guitar&oldid=702797509"          Categories: Classical guitarNonstandard-guitar tunings
