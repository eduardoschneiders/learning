It was released in the UK February 14, 2005 by Warner Music imprint Rushmore Records. Due to complications with Electric Six's former record label, Rushmore did not release the album in North America. In December 2005, the band announced a new partnership with Metropolis Records that resulted in Señor Smoke's North American release on February 7, 2006. Señor Smoke was ravaged by the UK press upon its 2005 release. However, the response to the album has been much more enthusiastic in America, with several positive reviews, including one from the March 2006 issue of Blender Magazine that claims that the album (which received four stars) is so good that "[it] achieves an advance modern medicine has long pursued: it restores virginity."

This was later revealed to be a "Download Mix" as opposed to the album version. The song "Bite Me" borrows the line "[I] have accountants pay for it all" from the Joe Walsh song, "Life's Been Good". The song "Jimmy Carter" borrows the line "Backstreet's back alright" from "Everybody" by Backstreet Boys. The song "Dance-A-Thon 2005" was retired from the band's live performances after 2005, however it returned in 2009 with the words changed to "Dance-A-Thon 2009". The song "Dance-A-Thon 2005" reprises the lines "I want to reach into the fire of your heart, I want to program all those beats right from the start, have you ever been to New York City? New York City!" from "Improper Dancing", a song on Electric Six's previous album "Fire". The song "Taxi to Nowhere" originated from the band's days as "The Wildbunch".
