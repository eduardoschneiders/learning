The temple follows the Roman or Latin rite and is under the jurisdiction of the Diocese of St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands (Dioecesis Sancti Thomae in Insulis Virgineis). It was opened and dedicated on 25 December 1921. It was built thanks to the promotion of Father John Guillo (who came from Michigan in 1918)[3] and Paul Dugal. He celebrated his first communion in 1922, and later that same year, the first couple married there on 29 November.[4] See also[edit]  Roman Catholicism in the United States Virgin Islands St. Anne Church  References[edit]   ^ Chapel of St. Anne in Frenchtown ^ Esq, Eric E.
