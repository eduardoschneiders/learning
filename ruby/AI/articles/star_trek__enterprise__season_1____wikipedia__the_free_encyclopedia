In the ninety years since Star Trek: First Contact, the Vulcans have been mentoring and guiding humans, routinely holding back scientific knowledge in an effort to keep them contained close to home, believing them to be too impulsive and emotionally dominated to function properly in an interstellar community. When Enterprise finally sets out, the Vulcans, often represented by T'Pol, are conspicuously close by. This generates some conflict as, in several early episodes, Archer and others often complain of the Vulcans' unsubtle methods of keeping an eye on them. The early encounters and historic culture of familiar Star Trek franchise races, such as the Vulcans, Klingons, Andorians, Ferengi, Nausicaans, and Risans are also explored further. The crew faces situations that are familiar to Star Trek fans, but are unencumbered and unjaded by the experience and rules which have built up over hundreds of years of Trek lore and canon established in previous Star Trek series. Star Trek: Enterprise takes pains to show the origins of some concepts which have become taken for granted in Star Trek canon, such as Lieutenant Reed's development of force fields and red alerts, and Captain Archer's and Sub-Commander T'Pol's questions about cultural interference eventually being resolved by later series' Prime Directive. A recurring plot device is the Temporal Cold War, in which a mysterious entity from the 27th century uses the Cabal, a group of genetically upgraded Suliban, to manipulate the timeline and change past events. Sometimes sabotaging Enterprise's mission and sometimes saving the ship from destruction, the entity's motives are unknown. Agent Daniels, a Temporal Agent from the 31st century, occasionally visits Archer to assist him in fighting the Suliban and undoing "damaged threads" in the timeline.

While Carson noted problems such as "one dimensional" secondary characters and a visual aesthetic that was at odds with the series' place in the chronology of the franchise, it was also noted that the "series looks terrific, its cast is immensely likeable, and its scripts are intelligent".[5] Awards[edit] Two episodes of the first season of Enterprise won and were nominated for various Emmy Awards. The series premiere "Broken Bow" was awarded an Emmy for "Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Series" and was nominated for two other categories, "Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series" and "Outstanding Makeup for a Series (Prosthetic)". A later episode, "Two Days and Two Nights", won in the category "Outstanding Hairstyling for a Series".[6] Media information[edit] The first season DVD was released on May 3, 2005, ten days before the broadcast of the final episode of the series. This release marked a couple of firsts for Star Trek TV series DVD releases. It was the first to include extensive deleted scenes (although footage cut from the premiere of Voyager had been included in a featurette previously), and it was the first to include an outtakes or blooper reel.
