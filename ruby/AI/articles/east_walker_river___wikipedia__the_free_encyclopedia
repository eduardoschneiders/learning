It drains part of the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada in the watershed of Walker Lake in the Great Basin.

The mainstem begins in the south end of the Bridgeport Valley in Mono County, California, and flows from there north past Bridgeport, where it is impounded to form the Bridgeport Reservoir. Perennial tributaries of the river above Bridgeport Reservoir begin with Green Creek (and its Summers Creek sub-tributary), then Virginia Creek (and its Dog Creek, Dunderberg Creek, and Clearwater Creek sub-tributaries). Next Robinson Creek and Buckeye Creek (and its Swauger Creek sub-tributary) enter the reservoir.[3] Below Bridgeport Reservoir, the East Walker River flows northeast through the Sweetwater Mountains where it crosses the state line into southern Lyon County, Nevada and skirts to the south of the Pine Grove Hills before flowing north to join the West Walker River approximately 7 mi (13 km) south of Yerington to form the Walker River. U.S. Highway 395 passes through the southern part of the East Walker River valley, connecting it via Conway Summit to the Mono Lake area and via Devil's Gate Pass to the West Walker River. California State Route 182 (also known as the Sweet Water Road) and its continuation Nevada State Route 338 head northeast along the southern East Walker River valley from their terminus on Highway 395 in Bridgeport, but then diverge from the river and head northwest to the West Walker River valley. Ecology and wildlife[edit] By-Day Creek, a tributary to Buckeye Creek, is believed to contain the last pure native Lahontan cutthroat trout (LCT) Oncorhynchus clarkii henshawi population in the Walker River basin and was never stocked with other species of fish. The population estimated from electrofishing in 1986 was about 1,000, but subsequent drought conditions probably reduced the population to about 250 in the early 1990s. Much of the upper watershed of By-Day Creek is a refuge for LCT managed by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife since 1979 and these fish are used to restock other parts of the watershed.[3] References[edit]   ^ a b U.S. Geological Survey Geographic Names Information System: East Walker River ^ U.S. Geological Survey.
