By combining discoveries in neuroscience with developments in computer programming, the team created technology that possesses the ability to interpret large amounts of visual data with increased accuracy.[7] This technology is based on the founders’ work in digitally replicating cortical neural networks’ ability to identify complex patterns within massive quantities of ambiguous and noisy data.[8] Cortica’s offerings have application in the search industry as well as for publishers and advertisers who want to display content or ads related to on-screen images.[9] Marketing industry leaders have predicted that visual search will be a major driver of consumer marketing efforts in coming years.[10] Research and Technology[edit] In 2006, Founders Raichelgauz, Odinaev, and Zeevi shared their findings with the 28th IEEE EMBS Annual International Conference in New York in a paper titled, “Natural Signal Classification by Neural Cliques and Phase-Locked Attractors”.[11] That same year, the team also published “Cliques in Neural Ensembles as Perception Carriers"[12] Funding[edit] Cortica raised $7 million in its Series A funding round, announced in August 2012. Investors included Horizons Ventures (the investment firm of Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-Shing), and Ynon Kreiz, the former chairman and CEO of the Endemol Group. Kreiz would also be joining Cortica as Chairman.[13][14] In May 2013, it was announced that Cortica had raised $1.5 million from Russian firm Mail.ru Group.[15][16] It later transpired that this was a part of Cortica's Series B funding round for $6.4 million, announced in June 2013. The round was led by Horizons Ventures, with participation from the Russian firm Mail.ru Group and other angel investors.[17][18] In its fourth funding round, Cortica has raised $20 million, bringing the total investments to $38 million.[19] According to a report from The Israeli lead Daily economic newspaper, TheMarker, the fourth round was led by a strategic Chinese investor who will probably help the company expand into the Asian market.[20] Media coverage[edit] GigaOm listed Cortica as one of the top deep learning startups in a November 2013 article surveying the field, along with AlchemyAPI, Ersatz, and Semantria.[21] References[edit]   ^ Grant, Rebecca.
