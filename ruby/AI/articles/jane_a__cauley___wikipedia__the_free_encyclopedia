She then continued to receive a MPH in Epidemiology/Public Health Nursing at the University of Pittsburgh in 1980 and a DrPH. in Epidemiology in 1983.[2] Career[edit] Cauley has been involved in women's health for over 25 years and is the Principal Investigator (PI) of cohort studies such as the Study of Osteoporotic Fracture (SOF) and the Osteoporotic Fracture Risk in Older Men (MrOS). She has made improvements for understanding osteoporosis in older men and women. She was the Co-PI for the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), study wide Chair of the Osteoporosis, and for almost throughout the whole trial she also was the Calcium and Vitamin D Committee. She is currently a Co-investigator for the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) for women transition-midlife to elder status-particular emphases on skeletal health, physical function and body composition changes, and a PI of a SWAN which examines novel measures of hip strength.[1][3] Research areas[edit] Cauley's research interests are on epidemiology of osteoporosis, osteoporosis treatment and the consequences of osteoporosis. She is also interested in breast cancer which is why she served on the American Society of Clinical Oncology Writing Group, about the use of bisphosphonates in women with breast cancer. She also focused on women's heatlh and aging, falls, the interaction between endogenous and exogenous hormones, risk factors, inflammation, and disease outcomes. She also examines the physical and psychological changes in postmenopausal women.[1][3] Awards received[edit]  1986 NHLBI, FIRST Award: Epidemiology of Apo-Lipoprotein in Older Women (HL40489) 1990 Public Health Honor Society, Delta Omega Society 1996 American Epidemiological Society Membership 2002 Pittsburgh Post-Gazette: 1 of 12 scientists chosen as making a difference in your health 2003 American Society for Bone & Mineral Research (ASMBR), Elected Council Member 2004 University of Pittsburgh, Graduate School of Public Health, (GSPH) Distinguished Alumni Award 2004 University of Pittsburgh, GSPH, President, Faculty Senate Executive Committee 2011 University of Pittsburgh, Provost’s Award for Excellence in Mentoring 2011 ASBMR, Frederic C.
