Sister stations WSBT, WNSN, WZOC   Webcast Listen Live   Website New Country 99.9 Website   WHFB-FM (99.9 FM) is a radio station licensed to Benton Harbor, Michigan, broadcasting a country music format and targeting the South Bend, Indiana market. WHFB is owned by Mid-West Family Broadcasting. Its signal is regularly heard as far as Chicago, Illinois, As far East as Battle Creek, Michigan and during some atmospheric conditions as far North as Grand Rapids, Michigan[citation needed] As of June 2011, the station has re-imaged from Cat Country 99-9 to Real Country 99-Nine. Previous to the current country format, WHFB-FM acted as a local station serving the Benton Harbor/St. Joseph area, with beautiful music and adult contemporary music formats. In September 2015, Schurz Communications, which previously held a minority interest in Douglas Road Radio, agreed to acquire full ownership of the company. The transaction is part of the $442.5 million acquisition of Schurz' broadcast interests, including WHFB-FM, by Gray Television.[1][2][3] Though Gray initially intended to keep Schurz' radio stations, on November 2, it announced that Mid-West Family Broadcasting would acquire WHFB-FM and Schurz' other South Bend radio stations for $5.5 million. Mid-West Family already owns several stations in the Benton Harbor-St. Joseph area, where the station's city of license is located.[4][5][6] The sale to Mid-West was consummated on February 16, 2016.
