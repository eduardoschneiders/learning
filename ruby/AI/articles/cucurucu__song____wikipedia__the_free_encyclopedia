(January 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)     "Cucurucu"   Single by Nick Malvery   from the album First Mind   Released 3 March 2014 (2014-03-03)   Format digital download   Length 4:26   Writer(s) Nick Malvery   Nick Malvery singles chronology      "Nitrous" (2013) "Cucurucu" (2014)       "Cucurucu" is a song by English musician Nick Mulvey. The song was released on 3 March 2014. Mulvey told The Cambridge News that the song's title is meaningless. "It's meant to be a noise a child would make," he explained. "It might relate to a bird sound too. It's actually quite similar to the noise they make in France for a cockerel. You know how we say 'cock-a-doodle-do'? Over there it's like that Cucurucu." "At its core it's my adaptation of DH Lawrence's poem Piano," Mulvey added. "The poem depicts a child under the piano, smiling as its mother sings, so I thought it would be lovely to have a song within the song. So I'm singing in her voice, really, and then I got the chorus about 'yearning to belong', so it's not just putting his words to my music. At first I was bothered by that, because I didn't think I should've changed it, but I've got used to it."[1]    Contents   1 Track listings 2 Charts 3 Release history 4 References 5 External links    Track listings[edit]    Digital download     "Cucurucu" – 4:26  Charts[edit]   Chart (2014) Peak position   Belgium (Ultratip Flanders)[2] 81   Scotland (Official Charts Company)[3] 30   UK Singles (Official Charts Company)[4] 26   Release history[edit]   Region Date Format(s) Label   United Kingdom 3 March 2014 digital download    References[edit]   ^ "Cucurucu by Nick Mulvey Songfacts". www.songfacts.com.
