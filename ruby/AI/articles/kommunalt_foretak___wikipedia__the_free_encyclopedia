Fylkeskommunalt foretak or FKF, in English: County Enterprise is an equivalent enterprise owned by a county. KFs and FKFs offer no limited liability for the owner, though they do have a separate board of directors and a managing director. If more than one municipality and/or county is owner, the company is instead an Intermunicipal company (IKS), Norwegian: Interkommunalt selskap. Municipalities and counties are also free to own limited companies.         v t e   Norwegian types of company          ANS AS ASA BA BL DA Enkeltpersonforetak Etat FKF KF KS HF IKS NUF RHF Sparebank SF Studentsamskipnad Stiftelse            This business-related article is a stub.
