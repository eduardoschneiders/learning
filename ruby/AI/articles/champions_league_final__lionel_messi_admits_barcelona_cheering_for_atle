         Lionel Messi admits the city of Barcelona will be cheering on Atletico Madrid in the Champions League final because “they don’t want to see Real Madrid win anything”, with the forward stoking the flames of the El Clasico rivalry ahead of the final round of La Liga fixtures.  Barcelona are one win away from beating Real to the title, but face the prospect of watching their two Spanish rivals battling it out for the right to succeed the Catalans as Champions League winners. Atletico knocked the reigning champions out of the competition in the quarter-finals, triggering a blip for Barcelona that they managed to recover from in time to hold on to their La Liga lead by the slimmest of margins.  Real are targeting their 11th victory in the European Cup final, more than any other club in the history of the tournament by some margin, and they secured the famous La Decima success in the 2013/14 final by defeating Atletico in a repeat of this season’s finale.

Speaking in an interview with ESPNFC.co.uk, Messi said: “Always for Barcelona, the fans don't want to see Real Madrid win anything, as they also feel toward us. But in the end it is a final that they made it to again and for us, we just need to focus on what we can win.”   <!--//--><![CDATA[// ><!--    jQuery(document).ready(function(){      if (jQuery(window).width() > 620){          var galleryTitle = jQuery(".container.grid-mod-gallery .gallery-title");       var galleryTitleText = galleryTitle.text();       var galleryTitleLength = galleryTitleText.length;              if(galleryTitleLength > 50) {         galleryTitle.css("font-size","17px");       }         if(galleryTitleLength > 60) {         galleryTitle.css({           "padding":"12px 20px",           "line-height":"22px"         });         }     }    });   //--><!]]>         Real Madrid 1 Manchester City 0 player ratings                                                                                                                                                                                        22           show all                                               Real Madrid 1 Manchester City 0 player ratings                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1/22                                  Real Madrid Keylor Navas: 7 out of 10                                            Had precious little to do for long periods as he equalled the record for most clean sheets in a single Champions League season                                  2016 Getty Images                                                  2/22                                  Dani Carvajal: 8 out of 10                                            Made most of lack of City attacks to surge forward and provide attacking outlet.

So winning two of three would be spectacular.”  On the subject of two out of three, Real will be looking to claim their second Champions League crown in three years, having conceded the trophy to Barcelona last season. Victory could well decide the fate of manager Zinedine Zidane, but in Atletico they face a side that they have not beaten this season.  “They are a team very uncomfortable to play against,” Messi said of Atletico’s strengths. “And [Diego Simeone] deserves much merit for what he has done and made his players believe in him and do things perfectly because he has been at this for a while now. Apart from this he has very good players and reserves, who also come in and do the job when they get a chance.”                                                                            More about:                                      Real Madrid                 Fc Barcelona                 Atletico Madrid                 Champions League                                       Reuse content
