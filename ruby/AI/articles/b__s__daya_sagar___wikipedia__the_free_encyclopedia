He graduated with BSc in 1987 from Shree Durga Prasad Saraf College of Arts and Applied Sciences, Sriramnagar, an affiliated college of Andhra University. Subsequently, he received the M.Sc and PhD degrees from the Andhra University College of Engineering-Visakhapatnam, India, in 1991 and 1994 respectively. His PhD thesis is on 'Applications of Remote Sensing, Mathematical Morphology, and Fractals to Study Certain Surface Water Bodies'. Career[edit] After receiving his doctorate, Sagar worked in Andhra University College of Engineering as a Research Associate (1994–95 and 1998-98) of CSIR, a Research Scientist/Principal Investigator (1997-7) in a Scheme for Extramural Research for Young Scientists funded by Ministry of Science and Technology. From 1998-2001, he worked as a Research Scientist at the Centre for Remote Imaging Sensing and Processing (CRISP) of the National University of Singapore. He was appointed Associate Professor of Faculty of Engineering and Technology, Multimedia University (MMU), Malaysia in 2001 and was also a Deputy Chairman of Centre for Applied Electromagnetics (2003–07) there. During 2007-13, he has been an Associate Professor at Indian Statistical Institute-Bangalore centre, and since 2009, he has been overseeing as founding head of SSIU, a unit established in 2009 as a constituent unit of its Computer and Communication Sciences Division. Since 2013, he has been a professor at Indian Statistical Institute. Research[edit] Sagar’s research contributions span both basic and applied fields involves fusion of computer simulations and modeling techniques in order to develop cogent models in discrete space to gain an understanding of dynamical behavior of complex terrestrial systems, such as water bodies, river networks, mountain objects, folds, dunes, landscapes, and rock porous media. He developed specific technologies and spatial algorithms for using data acquired at multiple spatial and temporal scalesfor developing cogent domain-specific models. His work employs concepts stemmed out of recent theories—such as mathematical morphology, fractals, chaos, and morphometrics—to develop spatial algorithms for (i) pattern retrieval, (ii) pattern analysis, (iii) simulation and modeling, and (iv) reasoning and visualization of the spatial and temporal phenomena of terrestrial and GISci relevance. His studies show that there exist several open challenges that need to be addressed by mathematical geosciences community. One of such challenges is to understand the complexity in spatiotemporal behaviors of several terrestrial phenomena and processes via construction of process-specific attractors that may range from simple to strange.[2] Professional[edit] Sagar has been honored with the Georges Matheron Lectureship Award of International Association for Mathematical Geosciences for outstanding research ability in the field of spatial statistics or mathematical morphology. In 2002 he received Krishnan Medal of the Indian Geophysical Union. As recipient of this medal, Sagar was made IGU Fellow in 2011. In 1995, he received Dr. Balakrishna Memorial Award from the Regional Centre of Andhra Pradesh Akademi of Sciences. He is an elected Fellow of Royal Geographical Society (1999), Fellow of Indian Geophysical Union (2011), Senior Member of IEEE (2003) and was a member of New York Academy of Science during 1995-96. He is on the Editorial Boards of Discrete Dynamics of Nature and Society, and Computers & Geosciences. He has published 60+ papers in peer reviewed international journals, 2 books, and 7 edited Special-Theme issues for well known journals.[3] He has been on Editorial Boards of Computers and Geosciences and Discrete Dynamics in Nature & Society.
