Contents   1 Song information  1.1 Music video   2 Chart performance 3 References    Song information[edit] According to the singer's official website [1], the song is "a love declaration about the imminent break-up from the person you love" .[1] The track was nominated for "Song of the Year" at the "Oye Awards" in Mexico, which was awarded to "Te Lo Agradezco, Pero No" by Alejandro Sanz and Shakira.[2] Music video[edit] The music video for this single was directed by Simon Brand, who directed another two videos for the artist ("Me Dediqué a Perderte" and "Que Lástima"). The shooting took place in Mexico City and Tampico, Tamaulipas, on May 12 to 14, 2007. The plot is about a love story (starred by Jaidy Michel) and also includes Fernández making a performance on a boat. The main performance of the song (with Alejandro and his band) is on the boat's helipad. This ship was built in Russia in 1998 and originally was intended as a drillship and starting in 2005 was reconstructed as a crane vessel. The aerial shot captures the size of the ship. For this video a crew of 200 people was needed. Along with the performance, a couple is shown with romantic attitudes, but as the history develops it is also shown that he does not trust her and tries to find evidence of infidelity, only to find out that she was not cheating on him and loses her.[3] The video received a nomination for the "Oye Award" for Video of the Year, losing to "Me Muero" by Spanish band La Quinta Estación.[4] Chart performance[edit] In the United States, on the Billboard Hot Latin Tracks the single entered at number 49 in the week of June 9, 2007,[5] climbing to number 24 the following week and eight weeks later (August 11) peaking at number 9.[6] The track spent 20 weeks on this chart, and ranked at number 38 in the year-end chart of 2007.[7]   Chart (2007) Peak position   Mexico (Monitor Latino) [8] 1   USA Billboard Hot Latin Tracks [9] 9   USA Billboard Latin Pop Airplay [10] 2   References[edit]   ^ ""Nuevo Sencillo Te Voy a Perder" on Alejandro Fernandez.com".
