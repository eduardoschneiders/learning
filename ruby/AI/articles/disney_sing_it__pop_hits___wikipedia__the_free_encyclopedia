It was released on October 6, 2009 across multiple platforms. Unlike the previous two releases in the Sing It series, Pop Hits does not feature an Xbox 360 release. New features to the game include a new score system, an upgraded version of Sing It Pro, playback performances through Sing It Encore, or Run The Risk which allows players to outbid each other's scores. Songs[edit] Disney Sing It: Pop Hits features a number of songs by Disney-affiliated artists as well as Disney Channel related shows and films such as Hannah Montana, High School Musical 3, Camp Rock Cast (Demi Lovato and the Jonas Brothers) and popular songs heard on Radio Disney.
