Thirty-two teams participated in the league, comprising four divisions of eight teams. Two points were awarded for a win and one point was awarded for a drawn game. The knock-out phase featured the top four teams from division one and the top two teams from division two. Tipperary won the league, beating Galway by 2-14 to 0-12 in the final.[1]    Contents   1 Overview  1.1 Division 1 1.2 Division 2 1.3 Division 3 1.4 Division 4   2 National Hurling League  2.1 Division 1  2.1.1 Table 2.1.2 Results   2.2 Division 2  2.2.1 Table   2.3 Division 3  2.3.1 Table   2.4 Division 4  2.4.1 Table     3 External links 4 References    Overview[edit] Division 1[edit] The National Hurling League's top division featured eight teams. Galway, the 1993 All-Ireland runners-up, suffered just one defeat, topped the group and guaranteed themselves a place in the National League semi-final. Reigning league champions Cork finished second and booked their place in the second semi-final. Third placed Tipperary and fourth placed Antrim secured their places in the league quarter-finals. In spite of finished third, Tipperary defeated Galway in the National League final to secure their 16th title. It was the team's last silverware under the management of Michael "Babs" Keating. Down at the other end of the table, Waterford, with five defeats, and Wexford, with six defeats, were relegated to Division 2 for the following season. Division 2[edit] In Division 2, Clare and reigning All-Ireland champions Kilkenny finished first and second respectively, thus securing automatic promotion to Division 1 for the following season. They also earned a place in the National League quarter-finals. Westmeath, who only managed one draw during the group stage, were automatically relegated to Division 3. Division 3[edit] Carlow finished the group stage without defeat, topping the group with 14 points. Their success ensured automatic promotion to Division 2. Mayo lost all seven of their group games, finishing with a points difference of -100, and were relegated to Division 4. Division 4[edit] Louth were the standard bearers in Division 4. They recorded six wins from seven games, thus ensuring their promotion to Division 3 for the 1994-95 National Hurling League. Cavan lost all seven of their group games, finishing with a points difference of -116. They had the dubious honour of being the worst hurling team in Ireland.
