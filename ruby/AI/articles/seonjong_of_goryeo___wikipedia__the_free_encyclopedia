He's the second son of Empress Inye and born in September, 1049. He was sealed as marquis of Gukwon (國原侯) in March, 1056. Harmony of Confucism and Buddhism made his political statue very stable. Also he propelled broad-range trade among Song, Jurchens, Liao dynasty of Khitans, and Japan. During his period, Buddhism in Korea grew a lot. His brother Uicheon brought 1,000 scriptures from Song and bought 4,000 scriptures from Liao, Song, and Japan. Furthermore, Seonjong founded many pagodas for Buddhist temples and presented clothing for soldiers guarding the borders. Even when bedridden due to an illness in 1092, he calmly accepted his nearing death on lieu of Buddhist virtues.[1] Family[edit]    King (father): Munjong(1019~1083) (reign 1046~1083) Queen Jungsinhyun (?~1092)  Empress Kyunghwa   Empress Sasuk  Son: Heonjong Unknown princess Suantaekju Princess Wonsin Son: Marquis of Hansan Unknown prince Unknown prince      See also[edit]  List of Korean monarchs List of Goryeo people Goryeo  References[edit]   ^ 삼국유사      Seonjong of Goryeo House of Wang Born: 9 October 1049 Died: 17 June 1094   Regnal titles   Preceded by Sunjong King of Goryeo 1083–1094 Succeeded by Heonjong   Korean royalty   New creation Marquis of Gukwon 1056–1083 Merged in the Crown           v t e   Rulers of Goryeo        () means temporary ruler  Taejo Hyejong Jeongjong I Gwangjong Gyeongjong Seongjong Mokjong Hyeonjong Deokjong Jeongjong II Munjong Sunjong Seonjong Heonjong Sukjong Yejong Injong Uijong Myeongjong Sinjong Huijong Gangjong Gojong Wonjong (Yeongjong) Chongnyeol Chungseon Chungsuk Chunghye Chungmok Chungjeong Gongmin U Chang Gongyang (Yi Seong-Gye)          Posthumous  Gukjo Uijo Sejo Daejong Anjong Munwon Junggan Yangheon                            Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Seonjong_of_Goryeo&oldid=713865950"          Categories: Goryeo rulers1049 births1094 deaths11th-century Korean monarchsHidden categories: Articles containing Korean-language text
