It is the band's first studio album since We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank, released in 2007, marking the longest gap between studio albums in their career. Modest Mouse recorded two albums worth of material in their sessions, though the second album still has several songs incomplete.[4] Joe Zook, who mixed We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank, also mixed Strangers To Ourselves. The album's cover features an aerial image of Venture Out RV Resort, located in Mesa, Arizona.[5]    Contents   1 Singles 2 Reception 3 Track listing  3.1 Vinyl edition   4 Personnel  4.1 Modest Mouse 4.2 Additional instrumentation   5 Charts 6 References 7 External links    Singles[edit] The first single from the album, "Lampshades on Fire", was made available on December 15, 2014 for streaming and digital download.[6] Another song from the album, "Coyotes", was made available for download on January 20, 2015. The third song to be made available, "The Best Room", was released on February 3, 2015, alongside the album's track listing.[1] A fourth track from the album, "The Ground Walks, with Time in a Box", was released on February 16, 2015.[7] On March 3, a fifth song from the album was released, the album's final track, "Of Course We Know".[8] Reception[edit]   Professional ratings   Aggregate scores   Source Rating   Metacritic 70/100[9]   Review scores   Source Rating   AllMusic [10]   The A.V.

The album holds a score of 70 out of 100 from Metacritic based on "generally favorable reviews".[9] While some lament the title's lack of experimentation and growth, other reviewers see the album as evidence of the band's evolution. Kyle Mcgovern of Spin Magazine calls the album "a rudderless 15-song set that slightly improves the standing of 2007's middle-of-the-moat We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank."[20] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic emphasises the strengths of the album's songs individually, but adds that "it's an album where the trees matter more than the forest."[10] Track listing[edit] All lyrics written by Isaac Brock, except "God Is an Indian and You're an Asshole" lyrics by Jeremiah Green.
