He began his career in non-league football with Cockfield.[1] Life and career[edit] Ashman was born in Staindrop, County Durham,[1] one of numerous children of Fred Ashman, a former professional jockey whose father had kept a livery stable in Paris,[2] and his wife Lavinia.[3] As a youngster, Ashman played football for Evenwood Juniors,[4] and went on to work as a miner, playing non-league football for Cockfield. In 1924, Second Division club Middlesbrough paid Cockfield a £10 fee and the promise of a friendly match for Ashman's services.[5] Described on the club's website as a "composed half-back ... blessed with energy and stamina", Ashman went on to establish himself as a first-team regular as Middlesbrough won the 1926–27 Second Division title.[5] He appeared less frequently the following season as Middlesbrough failed to maintain their First Division status, and even less in 1928–29 as they again won the Second Division championship.[6] He played regularly in 1929–30, but after two more years during which he made just 23 appearances,[6] he moved to Queens Park Rangers for a £500 fee.[7] He appeared intermittently during his first season with the club,[7] but in 1933–34 was ever-present in the left-back position in Third Division South matches,[8] and played in about half of the following season's fixtures.[9] He was transfer-listed in 1935, and was reported to be buying a newsagents in Barnard Castle, County Durham. In July, he was granted a free transfer, and amid interest from York City and other clubs,[10] signed for Third Division North club Darlington on a free transfer.[11] After playing in the first 15 matches of the season, Ashman sustained an injury and was replaced at left back by Charles Allan, who kept his place to the end of the season.[12][13] Ashman was released on a free transfer, and retired from football.[14] Ashman married Alice Simpson, daughter of a local councillor, at Cockfield Church in June 1929.[15] The 1939 Register finds the family living in Horse Market, Barnard Castle: Ashman was a self-employed newsagent and member of the Police War Reserve, and Alice was an ambulance driver with the WVS.[16] Ashman's death at the age of 81 was registered in the second quarter of 1984 in the Lancaster district of Lancashire.[17] Statistics[edit]  Appearances and goals by club, season and competition  Club Season League FA Cup Other Total   Division Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals   Middlesbrough 1924–25[6] Second Division 13 0 0 0 — 13 0   1925–26[6] Second Division 35 0 1 0 — 36 0   1926–27[6] Second Division 41 1 3 0 — 44 1   1927–28[6] First Division 15 1 2 0 — 17 1   1928–29[6] Second Division 3 0 1 0 — 4 0   1929–30[6] First Division 31 0 6 0 — 37 0   1930–31[6] First Division 4 0 0 0 — 4 0   1931–32[6] First Division 18 0 1 0 — 19 0   Total 160 2 14 0 — 174 2   Queens Park Rangers 1932–33[7] Third Division South 15 0 0 0 — 15 0   1933–34[8] Third Division South 42 0 4 0 1[a] 0 47 0   1934–35[9] Third Division South 21 0 1 0 3[a] 0 25 0   Total 78 0 5 0 4 0 87 0   Darlington 1935–36[12] Third Division North 14 0 0 0 1[b] 0 15 0   Career total 252 2 19 0 5 0 276 2     ^ a b Appearance(s) in Football League Third Division South Cup ^ Appearance in Football League Third Division North Cup   References[edit]   ^ a b c d Joyce, Michael (2004).
