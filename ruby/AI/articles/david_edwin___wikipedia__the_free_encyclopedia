He was the son of John Edwin, a celebrated comic actor, and was apprenticed to an engraver, but he ran away to sea, and reached America in 1797. There he was employed by Edward Savage, the portrait painter, and soon gained much reputation by his portraits. After twenty years' work his sight failed, and he was compelled to resort to various means in order to obtain a livelihood. He died at Philadelphia in 1841.
