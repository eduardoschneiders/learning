It is south of The Blue Mountains, Ontario and of the Grey Highlands.[1][2] Wareham is close to the Osprey Wetland Conservation Lands.[2] Both the Saugeen Valley Conservation Authority and the Nottawasaga Valley Conservation Authority bought land here to protect the headwaters of several important rivers. The Osprey Wetlands are in the headwaters of the Saugeen River, as well as the Grand, the Beaver of Grey County, the Mad, and a tributary of the Nottawasaga River.[3] This Wetland is a raised bog.[4] It is the home of Darrell Markewitz, an artisan blacksmith who designed the living history program for L'Anse aux Meadows, Newfoundland for Parks Canada.[5] His forge is called Wareham Forge.
