His studies of the Sphinx have contributed to the controversial debate regarding a possible older dating of the monument. He suggested on the basis of weathering evidence that the Sphinx is older than its commonly accepted 4th dynastic date and instead it and two other buildings on the Giza Plaeau date to the early dynastic or late predynastic period.
