The elections coincided with elections for other federal and state offices, including a quadrennial presidential election. A jungle primary will take place on November 6, with a runoff, if necessary, held on December 8.[1]    Contents   1 Overview 2 Redistricting 3 District 1  3.1 Non-Partisan Primary and General Election Results   4 District 2  4.1 Non-Partisan Primary and General Election Results   5 District 3  5.1 Non-Partisan Primary 5.2 General Election Results   6 District 4  6.1 Non-Partisan Primary and General Election Results   7 District 5  7.1 Non-Partisan Primary and General Election Results   8 District 6  8.1 Non-Partisan Primary and General Election Results   9 References 10 External links    Overview[edit]   United States House of Representatives elections in Louisiana, 2012[2][3]   Party Votes Percentage Seats +/–    Republican 1,143,027 67.02% 5 -1    Democratic 359,190 21.06% 1 —    Libertarian 124,572 7.30% 0 —    Independents 78,828 4.62% 0 —   Totals 1,705,617 100.00% 6 —   Redistricting[edit] During the redistricting process, U.S. Representative Charles Boustany advocated a plan which, rather than drawing his home and that of Landry into the same district (as the bill which became law did), would instead make fellow Republican Representative John Fleming's district potentially more competitive. Fleming later said of Boustany, "I don't feel like I can trust anything he says. Everything he told me, he reneged on."[4] Due to difficulties reaching a consensus among the congressional delegation, U.S. Representatives Rodney Alexander, Bill Cassidy, Fleming, Jeff Landry and Steve Scalise wrote to Governor Bobby Jindal requesting that the state legislature postpone the redistricting process for a year.[5] Nonetheless, a redistricting bill was passed by the Louisiana House of Representatives and Louisiana Senate, and was signed into law by Jindal on April 14, 2011.[6] Louisiana is among the states which, according to a provision of the 1965 Voting Rights Act enacted upon states with a history of denial of voting rights, must submit legislative maps to the U.S. Department of Justice for approval in order to ascertain that the purpose and effects of the map are not discriminatory.[6] District 1[edit] Republican Steve Scalise, who has represented the 1st district since 2008, is running for re-election.[7][8] In redistricting the 1st district has been extended from Metairie towards the Gulf Coast[9] and includes the cities of Slidell and Houma, and the two parishes hardest hit by Hurricane Katrina, St. Bernard and Plaquemines.[7] It comprises 373,405 White Americans registered voters, 46,542 African Americans and 30,126 people of other ethnicities.
