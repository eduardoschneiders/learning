(January 2010)   Kilometer-square Area Radio Synthesis Telescope (KARST) is a Chinese telescope project to which FAST is a forerunner. KARST is a set of large spherical reflectors built on bowl-shaped limestone sinkholes, in a karst landform in China. It will consist of about 30 individual elements, each about 200 meters in diameter. A site survey of 288 suitable locations was performed in Pingtang county, Guizhou province, and optimal sites will be chosen towards signal performance. References[edit]  Nan, R.; et al.
