Biography[edit] He was named Meister der Kölner Ursula-Legende after a series of paintings depicting the life of Saint Ursula once found in the Basilica of St. Severin, Cologne.[1] Since WWII, when much of it was lost, the remaining fragments of paintings are spread in various museums. He is not to be confused with the Master of St. Severin, also from Cologne, who worked in the same period, or with the Bruges master named for a different version of the life of Ursula.
