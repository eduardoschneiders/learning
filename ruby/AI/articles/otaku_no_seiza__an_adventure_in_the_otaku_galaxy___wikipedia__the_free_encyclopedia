The game is a combination of science fiction and comedy in which a nameless hero arrives in a city where women have stolen the rights of men. The player controls the man as he tries to free men in the city. Otaku no Seiza features turn-based battles, similar to the Dragon Quest series. Gameplay[edit] Otaku no Seiza features standard role-playing video gameplay. Players control a party of characters through overhead environments, including towns, dungeons, and a world map. While on the world map or in a dungeon, the party will randomly encounter enemies. The perspective switches to a first-person mode and the enemies and party members take turns attacking or healing. Plot[edit] Otaku no Seiza tells the story of Fuyuu City, a place built in space far in the future. Aurora, a group of five attractive and powerful women, control the city. Men in the city are treated poorly compared to women, until the protagonist finds himself in the middle of the city with amnesia. Outraged, the protagonist decides to defeat Aurora and gain rights for the discriminated men of the city.
