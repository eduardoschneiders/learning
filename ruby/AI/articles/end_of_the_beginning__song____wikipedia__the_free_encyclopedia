According to lyricist Geezer Butler, the song deals with the fear of how "technology is going to completely take over the human race", inspired particularly by cloning: "It seems like eventually, people are going to clone the Beatles and stuff like that. I mean, it’s already happening now with a "Tupac" at Coachella, using holograms. But eventually I think they’ll start cloning people like the Beatles, and sending them out on endless tours."[4] "End of the Beginning" was premiered during the finale of season 13 of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. The band guest starred in the episode,[5] and also appeared in a short interview prior to its release.[6] The song was first performed live on 20 April 2013, on the first of the two Auckland shows in New Zealand. The performance was part of their reunion tour.[7] It was also featured in the end credits of the film This Is the End. On 11 June, coinciding with the album's launch, Black Sabbath released a full performance video from the CSI season 13 finale of length 8:20. The single peaked at the number 38 in US Mainstream Rock Chart.
