Touted as a drug of the future,[1] metelimumab was dropped from further development in favour of fresolimumab,[2] which is currently being developed by Genzyme.[3] History[edit] Metelimumab was isolated by Cambridge Antibody Technology (CAT) using its phage display technology. In 2000, CAT signed a collaborative deal with Genzyme to further develop TGF beta antibodies.[4][5] In 2004, CAT and Genzyme revealed that Phase I/II trials of metelimumab for scleroderma showed this antibody to be safe and well tolerated across all dose levels, although no conclusions regarding efficacy of the compound could be made.[6] Initial trials targeted the skin condition scleroderma[7] but, after some unsuccessful clinical trial results, the product was dropped in favour of fresolimumab,[2] which is currently being developed by Genzyme.[3] References[edit]  ^
