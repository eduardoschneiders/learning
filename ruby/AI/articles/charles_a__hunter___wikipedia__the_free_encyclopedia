He joined the Army in June 1862, and first saw action at the Battle of Charlestown. He was promoted to Corporal in November 1863, and would serve as a color guard or color bearer for his company in every battle in which they served. Hunter subsequently saw extensive action in the Shenandoah Valley, fighting at the Battles of Newmarket, Piedmont, Lynchburg, Snicker's Ford, Second Kernstown and Martinsburg, Halltown, Berryville, Third Winchester, Fisher's Hill, Stickney's Farm, and Cedar Creek. With the conclusion of Sheridan's Valley campaign, the 34th moved to the Petersburg theater of war. During the final assault on Petersburg on April 2, 1865, Hunter was among the first of his company to enter Fort Gregg in the defensive works, bearing the company's colors, an act for which he received the Medal of Honor. He was also promoted to Sergeant at the end of the month. Hunter's medal was presented to him on June 13, 1865 by the wife of his commander, General John Gibbon, and he mustered out with his regiment 3 days later.
