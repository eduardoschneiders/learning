It lies in the flood-prone district of Saran and it is very near the Ganges. The Ganga takes a curb at this point going to South. The image of the Ganga at this point is Lingvat. Even during a flood, the Ganga never touches the fort. The entire structure of Temple is on debris. During 1973 the then Director of the Department of Archaeology of the Government of Bihar Sri Prakash Chandra excavated and found a wall made of bricks used during the Pal dynasty. In the worship of Sakti an equidistant triangle has the same importance as Saligram for Lord Vishnu and Shiv Ling for Lord Shiva. The centre of the triangle is called Prambika Or Ambika. Surprisingly the distance of the three Siv Temples (Baidyanath , Vishwanath and Pashupati Nath) are equal and if you draw an imaginary line connecting the three Shiva Temple it will an equidistant triangle with Ambika Asthan Ami in the centre. This shows the importance of Ambika Asthan Ami. This place is also said to be the same place where King Surath & Samadhi Vaishya , performed AGYA for three years and got the desire fulfilled with the grace of Divine mother. It is also said that the place Digwara was originally called Drigdwara. This was the main gate of the palace of Daksh Prajapati where he organised Yagya. The palace was destroyed by Maa Sati. There are many other places claiming the same importance but in view of the fact that the incidence of Sati Sacrifice took place in Adi Satyug and has been repeated in every Satyug such claim and counterclaim can not be denied. There is a belief associated with the temple is that [2] one who worships over here, his/her wishes get fulfilled by the Goddess. Hence in Dussehra, worshippers from different places gather here to obtain the divine blessing. Important Festivals[edit] Navratri[edit] As the temple is devoted to Goddess Ambika, Navratri is celebrated and there is one small village fair also organised by the local people of Aami village. Shivratri[edit] Shivratri is organised with quite a lot of excitement among the local people, as this was the place where the marriage ceremony of Shiv and Sati took place. Shiv-Vivah[edit] This festival is of high importance being organised in the manner of the marriage of Shiv and Sati. From one side the bride prepares and from one side comes the groom; according to this a fairy marriage ceremony is organised in a holy hindu way.[clarification needed] Transportation[edit] The nearest airport is Jayprakash Narayan Airport patna at a distance of about 57 km from the temple. The Aami Village lies on the roadside of NH 19. It connects with the major cities of Uttar Pradesh, and Bihar Aami is itself a railway station.
