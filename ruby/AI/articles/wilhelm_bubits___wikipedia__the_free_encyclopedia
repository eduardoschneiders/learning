At Steyr, Bubits created the Steyr M and S pistols which were released to market beginning in 1999. In late 2002 Bubits worked with weapons experts from the United Arab Emirates in a UAE government sponsored "Small Arms Project" to develop a series of modern pistols. The result of the collaboration was the Caracal Pistol. Weapons manufacturer Caracal International was incorporated in Abu Dhabi at the end of 2006.
