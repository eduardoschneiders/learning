GHS offers a full range of academic courses as well as art, journalism and music programs. In addition, many extracurricular after-school clubs and sports programs are made available for the student body. The school was the first in the district to use block scheduling, the practice of having four one-and-a-half-hour classes that alternate every other day. In 2007 the Freshmen Academy was created to provide a transition for junior high students to high school. The Freshmen Academy mimics the high school block schedule, while maintaining a smaller more cohesive environment for the freshmen students. The representative for Nebraska's 3rd District, Adrian Smith, graduated from Gering High School in 1989.
