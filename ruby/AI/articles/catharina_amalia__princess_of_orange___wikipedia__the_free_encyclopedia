After her birth was made public, 101 salute shots were fired at four places in the Kingdom of the Netherlands: Den Helder and The Hague in the Netherlands, Willemstad in the Netherlands Antilles, and Oranjestad in Aruba.[3] On 12 June 2004, Catharina-Amalia was baptised by Reverend Carel ter Linden in the Great Church in The Hague. Her godparents are her uncle Prince Constantijn, Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden, the (then) vice-president of the Council of State of the Netherlands Herman Tjeenk Willink, friend of her mother Samantha Deane, her uncle Martín Zorreguieta, and friend of her father Marc ter Haar.[4] Catharina-Amalia's maternal grandparents, Jorge Zorreguieta and María del Carmen Cerruti Carricart, were prohibited from attending her parents' wedding in 2002 due to Zorreguieta's involvement in the regime of General Jorge Rafael Videla, but were present at her baptism, which was a private rather than a state affair.[5] Education[edit]     The Princess of Orange with her family on the balcony of the Royal Palace of Amsterdam on 30 April 2013   Princess Catharina-Amalia has two younger sisters: Princess Alexia (born in 2005) and Princess Ariane (born in 2007). She lives with her parents and sisters in Villa Eikenhorst on the estate De Horsten in Wassenaar.[4] The family will move to Huis ten Bosch in The Hague in the future.[6] Since 10 December 2007, Catharina-Amalia has attended the public primary school Bloemcampschool in Wassenaar.[7] She now attends the Christelijk Gymnasium Sorghvliet in the Hague, where her aunt Princess Laurentien attended. [8] Her birthdays are traditionally celebrated with a concert at the Kloosterkerk in The Hague, which is attended by ambassadors and members of the royal household and the Council of State of the Netherlands.[9] She speaks Dutch, English, and some Spanish.[10] Royal engagements[edit] On her seventh birthday, a Douglas C-47 Skytrain once owned by her great-grandfather, Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld, was named after Catharina-Amalia by Peter Hartman. The princess herself was prevented from attending the naming ceremony by school obligations.[11] Catharina-Amalia was one of the bridesmaids at the wedding of her godmother, Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden and Daniel Westling; which took place in 2010 at Stockholm Cathedral in Sweden.[12] Queen Beatrix abdicated on 30 April 2013, and Catharina-Amalia, as the heir apparent to her father, assumed the title of Princess of Orange, becoming the first to do so in her own right (suo jure) since Mary of Baux-Orange in 1417 because only since 2002 has the female heir-apparent automatically become Princess of Orange. Princess Catharina-Amalia will assume a seat in the Advisory Division of the Council of State of the Netherlands upon reaching the age of majority at 18.[13] Titles, styles, honours and arms[edit] Titles[edit]  7 December 2003 – 30 April 2013: Her Royal Highness Princess Catharina-Amalia of the Netherlands, Princess of Orange-Nassau 30 April 2013 – present: Her Royal Highness The Princess of Orange, Princess of the Netherlands, Princess of Orange-Nassau  Queen Beatrix abdicated the Dutch throne on 30 April 2013. Upon the abdication, Princess Catharina-Amalia became the Princess of Orange as heir apparent.[14] Arms[edit]  Arms of Catharina-Amalia, Princess of Orange     Notes This coat of arms is used by the Princess of Orange and her sisters Princess Alexia and Princess Ariane.[15] Escutcheon Quarterly: I and IV azure billety or, a lion with coronet also or armed and langued gules, holding in his dexter paw a sword argent hilted or, and in his sinister seven arrows argent pointed and bound together or, which is of the Kingdom of the Netherlands; II and III or, a horn azure opened and bound gules, which is of the first House of Orange; an inescutcheon or bearing a castle of three towers gules flanked on each side by a poplar tree au naturel, and a river azure flowing from the base, ondoyant to the gate of the castle, which is of the house of Zorreguieta in Argentina.
