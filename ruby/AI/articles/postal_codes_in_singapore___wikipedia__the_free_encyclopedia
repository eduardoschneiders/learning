They are administered by Singapore Post.    Contents   1 6-Digit Postal Code 2 Postal districts 3 History 4 Addressing from overseas 5 References    6-Digit Postal Code[edit] The 6-digit postal code is made up of the sector code and the delivery point. The sector is represented by the first two numbers of the postal code. The remaining four numbers define the delivery point within the sector. e.g.  56 Tanglin Road Singapore 247964  24 is the sector code; 7964 is the delivery point, i.e. house or building. For Housing and Development Board (HDB) residential blocks, the block number is included in the postal code. e.g.  Blk 335 Smith Street Singapore 050335  HDB residential blocks with the same number in the same postal sector are differentiated by their postal codes as follows: e.g.  Blk 110 Simei Street 1 Singapore 520110  Blk 110 Tampines Street 11 Singapore 521110  The postal codes for private residential, commercial and industrial houses and buildings are assigned based on the alphabetical sequence of the street names in each sector. This means that the codes for a particular postal sector have been assigned first to houses and buildings located along street names beginning with 'A, followed by 'B' and so on. The postal codes for such properties do not contain the corresponding house or building numbers included in the postal code. HDB industrial and commercial blocks also use this system.[1] Postal districts[edit] This table lists the postal districts:[2]   Postal District Postal Sector (1st 2 digits of 6-digit postal codes) General Location   01 01, 02, 03, 04, 05 Raffles Place, Cecil, Marina, People's Park   02 07, 08 Anson, Tanjong Pagar   03 14, 15, 16 Queenstown, Tiong Bahru   04 09, 10 Telok Blangah, Harbourfront   05 11, 12, 13 Pasir Panjang, Hong Leong Garden, Clementi New Town   06 17 High Street, Beach Road (part)   07 18, 19 Middle Road, Golden Mile   08 20, 21 Little India   09 22, 23 Orchard, Cairnhill, River Valley   10 24, 25, 26, 27 Ardmore, Bukit Timah, Holland Road, Tanglin   11 28, 29, 30 Watten Estate, Novena, Thomson   12 31, 32, 33 Balestier, Toa Payoh, Serangoon   13 34, 35, 36, 37 Macpherson, Braddell   14 38, 39, 40, 41 Geylang, Eunos   15 42, 43, 44, 45 Katong, Joo Chiat, Amber Road   16 46, 47, 48 Bedok, Upper East Coast, Eastwood, Kew Drive   17 49, 50, 81 Loyang, Changi   18 51, 52 Simei, Tampines, Pasir Ris   19 53, 54, 55, 82 Serangoon Garden, Hougang, Ponggol   20 56, 57 Bishan, Ang Mo Kio   21 58, 59 Upper Bukit Timah, Clementi Park, Ulu Pandan   22 60, 61, 62, 63, 64 Jurong   23 65, 66, 67, 68 Hillview, Dairy Farm, Bukit Panjang, Choa Chu Kang   24 69, 70, 71 Lim Chu Kang, Tengah   25 72, 73 Kranji, Woodgrove, Woodlands   26 77, 78 Upper Thomson, Springleaf   27 75, 76 Yishun, Sembawang   28 79, 80 Seletar   History[edit] Singapore was originally divided into 28 postal districts in 1950, with a number being allocated to each district, for example, the Orchard Road area was in District 9.  277 Orchard Road Singapore 9  This was superseded by a new four-digit system in 1979, with the last two digits representing a sector in each district. There were in total 81 sectors.  277 Orchard Road Singapore 0923  On 1 September 1995, this was replaced by a six-digit system, in which every building was given its unique postcode, the first two digits of which represented the old sector, i.e. 23.  277 Orchard Road Singapore 238858  Although the old districts are no longer used by Singapore Post, they are still widely used to refer to locations of properties for sale or rent.[3][4] Addressing from overseas[edit] SingPost recommends the following format for addresses:[5]   Example Format   Ms. Tan Bee Soo 16 Sandilands Road SINGAPORE 546080 REP.
