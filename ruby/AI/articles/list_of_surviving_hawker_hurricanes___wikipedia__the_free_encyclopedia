France[edit] Airworthy[edit]  Hurricane Mk IIa DR393 (registered F-AZXR, formerly ZK-TPK) was originally a Mk I P3351. It was delivered to the RAF, and crashed near Prestwick on 21 July 1940.

India[edit] On display[edit]  Hurricane displayed as Mk.IIa AP832, and later AB832, though these serials have never been allocated[7] (the former is in a deliberate blank block between Hurricane Mk.IIb's, and the latter is a deliberate blank block between Spitfire serials).
