Krohn, who served as Board of Park Commissioner[2] from 1912 to 1948. The architect firm Rapp & Meacham designed the conservatory in the Art Deco style, in the form of a Gothic arch.[3][4] A 1966 hailstorm caused extensive damage to the conservatory, and the firm of Lord & Burnham was called to restore it.[5] The original wooden sashes were replaced with durable aluminum.[6] Collection[edit] It contains more than 3,500 plant species from all over the world,[7] with principal collections as follows:  Bonsai Collection - a collection of bonsai trees from the conservatory itself, the Bonsai Society of Greater Cincinnati, and private individuals. Desert Garden - succulents and cacti[8] including agaves, aloes, crassulas, and yuccas, as well as Cereus, Opuntia, and Pereskia. Floral Display - home to six seasonal floral shows, with a permanent citrus tree collection of orange, kumquat, giant Ponderosa lemon, and grapefruit. Orchid Display - approximately 75 blooming orchids at any time, from the conservatory's collection of thousands of orchids encompassing 17 genera. This display also includes a Monstera deliciosa. Palm House - a 45-foot (14 m) high central house with palm trees, rubber trees, and bananas, shrubby plants, and ground cover, as well as a 20-foot (6.1 m) waterfall[9] with a goldfish stream. Epiphytic bromeliads, orchids, and ferns grow in many of the trees. Tropical House - a large variety of ferns,[10] both terrestrial and epiphytic; cycad, bromeliad, and begonia collections; and important economic plants including a cacao tree, Pomegranate, vanilla vine, and dwarf banana.
