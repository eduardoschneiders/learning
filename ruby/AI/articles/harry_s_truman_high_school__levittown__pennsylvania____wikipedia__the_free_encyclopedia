(February 2008) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)   Known regionally and nationally, Truman's drama program was led by Louis Volpe for about 45 years until his retirement in June 2013. In October 2012, the Bristol Township school board approved a resolution that would name Truman’s auditorium after Louis Volpe. They were honored for their excellence by being chosen to pioneer Les Misérables for high school use in 2001. They received that honor again in 2007 and performed the pilot of the student edition of Rent. In spring 2006 Beauty and the Beast was performed, which garnered nearly-universal positive reviews. They performed the Disney-produced musical Aida in spring 2007. Past works include: Epic Proportions, Godspell (2013), Jesus Christ Superstar, Equus, Found a Peanut and Grease. They have been granted the rights to pioneer their next Broadway-born show, Spring Awakening. Spring Awakening premiered in November and it was a huge success. After the departure of Volpe, Tracey Krause, (now Tracey "Craig"), assumed the position of director after being assistant director for several years. Author Michael Sokolove wrote the book Drama High, which focuses on the life of Lou Volpe. Sports[edit]      This section needs additional citations for verification.
