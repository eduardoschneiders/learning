Conical pendulum clock by Farcot and sculptor Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse, 1867.       Farcot museum.   Henry Eugène Adrien Farcot (February 20, 1830 – March 14, 1896) was a Parisian clock-maker working from 1858 to 1890. He was born in Sainville, France, to Louis François Désiré Farcot and Emelie Delafoy, and studied at the École d'horlogerie de Cluses. He died in Saint Saint-Maur-des-Fossés, just outside Paris. Farcot first employed a conical pendulum in a clock in 1861, and patented a number of conical pendulum and mystery clocks throughout his career. He exhibited his clocks at the 1862 International Exhibition in London, Exposition Universelle (1867) in Paris, Centennial Exposition (1876) in Philadelphia, and Exposition Universelle (1878) in Paris. In addition to clock-making, he was a member of the Société aérostatique et météorologique de France, and wrote a book on lighter-than-air craft. The Musée Farcot, in Sainville, preserves memories of his life and work. Works[edit]  La navigation atmosphérique, Librairie Nouvelle, 1859.
