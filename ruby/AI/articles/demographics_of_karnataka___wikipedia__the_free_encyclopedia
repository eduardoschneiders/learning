World's first two birth control clinics were set up in Karnataka in the district of Mandya.[3] Even though health care in Karnataka's private sector is among world's best,[6] state as a whole has not been fully successful in providing effective primary health care. Apart from capital Bangalore and coastal districts of Udupi and Dakshina Kannada other parts of the state especially northern districts have not received sufficient attention by government and private sectors.[3] However Karnataka has established a modicum of public health services having a better record of health care and child care compared to other states of India.[7] The state has a birth rate of 2.2%, death rate of 0.7%, an infant mortality rate of 5.5%, a maternal mortality rate of 0.2% and 2.2 being total fertility rate.[3] In 2004 state's Health and Family Welfare Services had 8,143 sub-centres (one for 5,000 people), 581 Primary Health Units (PHUs), 1,679 Primary Health Centres (PHCs), 19 mobile units, 7,304 maternity annexes, 17 urban PHCs and 110 Community Health Centres. There were 87 Urban Family Welfare Centres, 124 Urban Health Centres and 24 district level and 149 taluk level hospitals. Six government hospitals in Karnataka have won ISO-9002 certification. During 2004-05 Karnataka slipped from the sixth place to the seventh in the Human Development Index. During fiscal year 2004-05, only 0.7% of total GSDP was allocated to health sector.[3] Karnataka is one of the states of India most seriously affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic and stands fifth on the number of reported AIDS cases in the country. The first case of AIDS was detected in the state in 1988. Of the 49 high prevalence HIV/AIDS districts in India, 10 are in Karnataka.[8] This has caused Karnataka to become the first state in India to bring in legislation making pre-marital HIV tests compulsory.[9] In 2010, the Government of Karnataka approved new state-of-the-art HIV/AIDS prevention education developed at Stanford University by U.S. nonprofit TeachAIDS, and committed to distributing them in 5,500 government schools.[10] Karnataka is also home to Handigodu Syndrome, a rare and painful osteoarthritic disorder endemic to the Malnad region of the state.
