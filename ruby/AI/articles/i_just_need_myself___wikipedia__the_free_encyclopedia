The song was released in 2003 and reached number 13 in the UK Singles Chart, making it the highest charting Ocean Colour Scene song since "Profit in Peace" from 1999. It was released as the lead single from their 2003 album North Atlantic Drift. A remix of the song is a B-side to the 2007 single, "I Told You So". The song was originally going to be a blues-style song, but guitarist Steve Cradock came up with the opening riff and decided to use that instead. Lead singer Simon Fowler says the lyrics are about the first things you think about when your head hits the pillow.
