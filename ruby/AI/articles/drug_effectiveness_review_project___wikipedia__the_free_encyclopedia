(April 2012) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)   The Drug Effectiveness Review Project (DERP) is an Oregon-based collaboration of public and private organizations, including fifteen states, that have joined together to provide systematic evidence-based reviews of the comparative effectiveness and safety of drugs in many widely used drug classes and to apply the findings to inform public policy and related activities. It is managed at Oregon Health & Science University. The purpose of the DERP reports is to make available information regarding the comparative effectiveness and safety profiles of different drugs within pharmaceutical classes. DERP reports are not usage guidelines, nor should they be read as an endorsement of or recommendation for any particular drug, use or approach. Oregon Health & Science University does not recommend or endorse any guideline or recommendation developed by users of these reports. Sources[edit]  Neumann, P. J. (2006).
