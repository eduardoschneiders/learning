His father worked in the Hillsboro coal mines. He left school at a young age and worked various jobs but eventually was awarded a scholarship to Brookwood Labor College[1] in Katonah, New York. Stage[edit] Bellaver was a member of the Hedgerow Players of Rose Valley, Pennsylvania, for eight years.[2] Early in Bellaver's career he appeared in numerous Broadway plays. He made his Broadway debut in the 1931 Group Theatre in the play 1931.[3] He also appeared in the Elmer Rice play We, the People in 1933, and in the Broadway debut that year of The Threepenny Opera. Bellaver's greatest Broadway success was in 1946, when he appeared in the original production of Annie Get Your Gun, as Chief Sitting Bull. He appeared in the same role in the 1966 revival. Film[edit] Bellaver was also a prolific film character actor, mainly in "working class" roles, from 1939 through the 1960s. He appeared in the film adaptation of From Here to Eternity and in several notable film noirs. He played the role of ex-convict "Creeps" in 1939's Another Thin Man with William Powell and Myrna Loy. He appeared in The House on 92nd Street (1945) as a taxi driver spying for the Nazis, and again played a cab driver, this time victimized by a gangster, in Side Street (1950). He also appeared in Love Me or Leave Me with James Cagney and Doris Day in 1955 and The Old Man and the Sea with Spencer Tracy in 1958. His other film roles included appearances in One Potato, Two Potato (1964), A Fine Madness (1966), Madigan (1968), The Hot Rock (1972), God Told Me To (1976), Blue Collar (1978), and the comedy Hero at Large (1980), starring John Ritter and Anne Archer. His last film role was as an old miner in the horror film The Stuff (1985). Television[edit] Bellaver is probably best known for his featured role as Sgt. Frank Arcaro in the television series Naked City appearing in 136 of the series' combined 138 episodes. He played an older, mellow detective who was a counterpoint to the dedicated young detectives played by James Franciscus and Paul Burke. He also was on Another World as Ernie Downs.[4] Military service[edit] Bellaver served in the Special Services Unit of the U.S. Army during World War II.[1] Personal life[edit] Bellaver was married to Dudley Vaugn.
