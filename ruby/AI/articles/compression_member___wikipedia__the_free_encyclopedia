That is, the loads are applied on the longitudinal axis through the centroid of the member cross section, and the load over the cross sectional area gives the stress on the compressed member. In buildings posts and columns are almost always compression members as are the top chord of trusses.    Contents   1 Description 2 See also 3 Notes 4 External links    Description[edit] For a compression member, such as a column, the principal stress comes mainly from axial forces, that is forces that fall along one line, usually the centerline.[1] The loading capacity of a short column is determined by strength limit of the material. The strength of a column of intermediate size is limited by its degree of inelasticity. A long column is constrained by the elastic limit (that is by amount of buckling).[1] See also[edit]  Arch Brown truss Buckling List of structural elements Truss Strut  Notes[edit]  ^ a b "Compression member".
