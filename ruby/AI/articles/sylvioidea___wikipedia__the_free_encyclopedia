It is one of at least three major clades within the Passerida along with the Muscicapoidea and Passeroidea. It contains about 1300 species including the Old World warblers, Old World babblers, swallows, larks, bulbuls and perhaps the tits. Members of the clade are found worldwide but fewer species are present in the Americas. Systematics[edit] The superfamily Sylvioidea was first proposed in 1990 in the Sibley–Ahlquist taxonomy of birds.[1] More recent studies have failed to support the inclusion of some families such as the treecreepers, wrens and allies but do support the addition of the larks.[2] Some of the families within the Sylvioidea have been greatly redefined. In particular, the Old World warbler family Sylviidae and Old World babbler family Timaliidae were used as wastebin taxa and included many species which have turned out not to be closely related. Several new families have been created and some species have been moved from one family to another.[3] List of families[edit]  Stenostiridae: fairy flycatchers Paridae: tits and chickadees Remizidae: penduline tits  It is not yet certain if the three families above belong in the Sylvioidea and they are sometimes treated as a separate superfamily, Paroidea.[3]  Panuridae: the bearded reedling; formerly classed as a parrotbill but seems to be closest to the larks.[4] Nicatoridae: nicators; have been classed as bulbuls in the past but appear to have no close relatives.[4] Alaudidae: larks Pycnonotidae: bulbuls Hirundinidae: swallows and martins Pnoepygidae: pygmy wren-babblers; apparently unrelated to other babblers.[5] Macrosphenidae: African warblers such as longbills and crombecs; a recently proposed family whose composition is still uncertain.[6] Cettiidae: bush warblers Aegithalidae: long-tailed tits Phylloscopidae: leaf warblers: Acrocephalidae: reed warblers and allies Locustellidae (or Megaluridae): grassbirds and allies Donacobiidae: the black-capped donacobius; previously classed as a wren but probably closest to the Megaluridae or Bernieridae.[7] Bernieridae: Malagasy warblers; a new family formally named in 2010.[8] Cisticolidae: cisticolas and allies Scotocercidae: streaked scrub warbler  The following groups form a single babbler radiation and it is not yet certain how many separate families should be recognized. Gelang et al. proposed a division into two families, Sylviidae and Timaliidae, with Timaliidae being divided into four subfamilies.[5] The list of the International Ornithological Congress provisionally recognizes five families.[9]  Timaliidae: tree babblers Pellorneidae: ground babblers Leiothrichidae: laughingthrushes and allies Sylviidae: Sylvia warblers and allies Zosteropidae: white-eyes and allies  References[edit]    Wikispecies has information related to: Sylvioidea      Wikimedia Commons has media related to Sylvioidea.     ^ Sibley, C.G. & Ahlquist, J.E.
