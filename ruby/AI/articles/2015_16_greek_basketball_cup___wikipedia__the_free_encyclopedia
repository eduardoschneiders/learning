Faros Keratsiniou was just the third team from the Greek 2nd Division that played in a Cup Final,[1] after Panellinios in 1987, and Rethymno Aegean in 2007, previously accomplished the feat. The game ended with the biggest margin between two teams in a Greek Cup Final in history. Panathinaikos broke the winning-margin record of Aris, who won 110-70 in the 1987 Greek Cup Final against Panellinios.
