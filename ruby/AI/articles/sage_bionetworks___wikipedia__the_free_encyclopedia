It is housed in the campus of Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and led by Stephen Friend who co-founded it with Eric Schadt.[1][2]    Contents   1 Open science 2 Research 3 History 4 References 5 External links    Open science[edit] Sage Bionetworks is notable for being an early advocate of open science.[3][4] The company operates a software platform for collaborative data analysis called Synapse[5] that allows researchers to work together on data curation and computational modeling asynchronously in a manner inspired by GitHub. Synapse also serves as the software infrastructure for running computational challenges.[6] Sage is also developing a citizen-science platform called Bridge.[7][8] Research[edit] The bulk of Sage's scientific results emerge from cancer and neurosciences, with notable contributions to the Cancer Genome Atlas Pan-Cancer project.[9] Another Sage initiative, The Resilience Project[10] describes itself as a search for individuals who have genetic changes expected to cause severe illness but who remain perfectly healthy. The hope is to yield insight into factors that protect these individuals from disease.[11][12] History[edit] Sage Bionetworks was founded in 2009 as a spinout of Merck & Co., who released software, hardware, intellectual property, and staff connected to its Rosetta Inpharmatics unit.[13] A donation from Quintiles provided early funding.[14] In March 2011 Sage partnered with CHDI Foundation to develop computer simulations for studying Huntington's disease. At the same time Sage also announced a partnership with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company wherein Sage would do research to identify biological targets for central nervous system diseases.[15] In March 2013, Sage Bionetworks merged with the Dialogue on Reverse Engineering Assessment and Methods (DREAM) project.[16] References[edit]   ^ Kaiser, Jocelyn (2012).
