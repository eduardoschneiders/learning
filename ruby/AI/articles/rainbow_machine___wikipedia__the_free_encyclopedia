Each pole is 12 feet tall and has a six-foot arm on each side that swivels at the center point. The face of each arm is covered with a holographic decal that reflects light, color and motion as the arm moves in the breeze. The work is oriented toward the Marquette Interchange a short distance from the entrance of the Haggerty Museum of Art.[1] History[edit] While fabricated in 1993, Rainbow Machine was not installed in Milwaukee until 2000. According to the Haggerty Art Museum, it was previously installed on Michigan Avenue in Chicago.[1] Artist[edit] Burlini is a graduate of the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and maintains a studio in Arlington Heights, Illinois.[2] References[edit]   ^ a b c "Haggerty Museum Grounds Home to New Outdoor Sculpture" (PDF).
