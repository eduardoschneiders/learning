She was not named on-panel initially. The character next appears as Magic in Rom Annual #4 (December 1985), and X-Men: Spotlight on Starjammers #2 (June 1990). The character subsequently appears as Magique in Quasar #32 (March 1992), JLA/Avengers #1 (September 2003), Uncanny X-Men #479 (December 2006), #485-486 (June-July 2007), and X-Men: Emperor Vulcan #5 (March 2008). Magic appeared as part of the "Imperial Guard" entry in the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition #6. Fictional character biography[edit] Magique is a founding member of the Shi'ar Imperial Guard. She has been present in many of the team's appearances, but has often remained in the background throughout most of the Guard's long history. She was present at the Guard's first battle with the X-Men.[1] She was also involved in the Guard's attack upon the Starjammers and Excalibur.[2] During the Kree-Shi'ar War, Magique and two of her teammates were sent to thwart the heroes Quasar and Starfox. During this encounter, she used her power to create illusions of nearly every other member of the Imperial Guard.[volume & issue needed] She appeared with the Imperial Guard during the crowning of Vulcan as emperor of the Shi'ar.[volume & issue needed] War of Kings[edit] During War of Kings, Guardians of the Galaxy member Adam Warlock fights with Emperor Vulcan in Guardians of the Galaxy #15. Later some Imperial Guardsmen, including Magique, are seen helping Vulcan. Magique is ordered by Mentor to attack Adam Warlock and after a short but heavy fight Magique seemed to have lost the battle and Warlock escapes. However, not all was lost, as Magique was able to put a 'witchmark' on Adam, without him knowing. Adam was followed by the Imperial Guard (via Magique's 'witchmark'). The Imperial Guardsmen attacked the Guardians of the Galaxy while Magique follows Adam Warlock, who somehow is able to transport the 'witchmark' back on her and therefore the Shi'ar soldiers shoot her instead of Adam Warlock.[volume & issue needed] Powers and abilities[edit] Originally described as a powerful sorceress, Magique's only confirmed superhuman ability is the creation of extremely realistic visual illusions. She can generate and maintain multiple animate illusions at once with no apparent strain, and can also use her power to render herself invisible at the same time. It is unknown if her illusions can affect senses other than sight, or if this power is but one facet of her supposed magical ability. Magique is apparently either immortal or possesses an extremely long lifespan, as she was seen in a flashback as one of the founding members of the Imperial Guard formed over four hundred years ago. Inspiration[edit] Several of the members of the Imperial Guard are at least partly based on members of the DC Comics team Legion of Super-Heroes. (Dave Cockrum, co-creator of the Guard, also had a long run as artist on the Legion.) Magique is based on LSH member Princess Projectra.[citation needed] References[edit]   ^ X-Men #107-109 ^ X-Men Spotlight On: The Starjammers #2   External links[edit]  Magique at the Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe          v t e   Marvel Cosmic       Alien Species    Badoon Beyonders Brood Celestials Dire Wraiths Galadorians Kree Phalanx Shi'ar Skrulls Spartoi Symbiotes Watcher         Connected Character/Groups        Beyonder Blood Brothers Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell) Collector Ego Galactus Grandmaster High Evolutionary Howard the Duck Maelstrom Magus Molecule Man Monark Starstalker Nebula Paibok Ra-Venn Super-Skrull Thanos Uatu The Watcher Wraith Universal Church of Truth         Annihilators    Beta Ray Bill Cosmo Gladiator Ikon Quasar Ronan the Accuser Silver Surfer         Elders of the Universe    Astronomer Caregiver Champion Collector Contemplator Ego Gardener Grandmaster Obliterator Possessor Runner Trader         Enigma Force    Arcturus Rann Jentorra Marionette (Mari) Bug Death's Head (Carl) Psyklop         Fraternity of Raptors    Darkhawk Gyre Razor Talon         Guardians of the Galaxy    Adam Warlock Drax the Destroyer Gamora Groot Mantis Quasar (Phyla-Vell) Rocket Raccoon Star-Lord         Heralds of Galactus    Air-Walker Fallen One Firelord Morg Nova Red Shift Silver Surfer Stardust Terrax         Imperial Guard    Astra Electron Fang Flashfire Gladiator Hobgoblin Magique Mentor Neutron Nightside Oracle Pulsar Smasher Starbolt Titan         Infinity Watch    Adam Warlock Drax Gamora Moondragon Pip the Troll Thanos         Nova Corps    Garthan Saal Irani Rael Powerhouse Richard Rider (Nova Prime) Rhomann Dey Sam Alexander         Spaceknights    Firefall Rom Starshine Terminator         Starjammers    Ch'od Corsair Hepzibah Korvus Raza Longknife            Microverse    Bug Jarella Psycho-Man         Negative Zone    Annihilus Blastaar Praxagora Ravenous         Storylines    The Infinity Gauntlet Infinity War Infinity Crusade Annihilation Annihilation: Conquest War of Kings Realm of Kings The Thanos Imperative Infinity The Black Vortex         Superhuman Races    Deviant Eternals Inhumans         Related articles    Cosmic entities Knowhere                            Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Magique&oldid=723914610"          Categories: Comics characters introduced in 1977Characters created by Chris ClaremontCharacters created by Dave CockrumExtraterrestrial superheroesMarvel Comics characters who use magicMarvel Comics aliensMarvel Comics superheroesHidden categories: Articles needing additional references from October 2010All articles needing additional referencesComics infobox without imageCharacter popComics articles needing issue citationsArticles with unsourced statements from April 2009Articles with unsourced statements from June 2009All articles with unsourced statementsArticles with unsourced statements from August 2011
