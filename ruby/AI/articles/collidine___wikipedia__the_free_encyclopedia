(December 2009) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)   Collidine is the trivial name used to describe the chemical compounds trimethylpyridine. Their chemical properties resemble those of pyridine, although the presence of the methyl groups will prohibit some of the more straightforward reactions. Collidine comes in several isomers:  2,3,4-trimethylpyridine 2,3,5-trimethylpyridine 2,3,6-trimethylpyridine 2,4,5-trimethylpyridine 2,4,6-trimethylpyridine (the most common example of the isomers) 3,4,5-trimethylpyridine.  All isomers share the molecular weight 121.18 g/mol and the chemical formula C8H11N.
