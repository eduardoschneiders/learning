While in Penticton, he met George Melville, a chartered accountant. Melville acted as Treliving's business consultant for four years until 1973, at which time he became Treliving's partner in the business. In 1983, Treliving and Melville acquired the Boston Pizza chain from then-owner Ron Coyle. The two then divested 15 of their restaurants to other franchisees and converted one restaurant to a corporate training restaurant. By 1995 the chain had grown to 95 restaurants in Western Canada with sales in excess of $110 million (CA$).[3] Through T&M, Treliving and Melville share the title of Chairman and Owner of Boston Pizza International (as Boston Pizza Royalties Income Fund), the owners of casual-dining restaurant company Boston Pizza, a franchiser.
