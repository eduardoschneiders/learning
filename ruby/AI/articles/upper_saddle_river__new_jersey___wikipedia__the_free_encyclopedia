The area was granted borough status in 1894 and remained principally rural until the 1950s. The suburban growth of New Jersey affected Upper Saddle River and surrounding municipalities, as the borough's population increased tenfold from 1950 to 1970. The population has remained fairly constant since 1970.     Hopper-Goetschius House Historic Marker in Upper Saddle River   Predominantly a residential community consisting of one-acre (4,000 m2) lots, Upper Saddle River also contains a library, police station, fire station, ambulance corps, municipal hall, and three primary schools. Commerce and industry are concentrated along the town's western border along Route 17. Postal service is shared with the neighboring borough of Saddle River.[14] Upper Saddle River was formed as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on November 22, 1894, from portions of Hohokus Township and Orvil Township, based on the results of a referendum held two days earlier.[20] The borough was formed during the "Boroughitis" phenomenon then sweeping through Bergen County, in which 26 boroughs were formed in the county in 1894 alone. Upper Saddle River's referendum passed on November 20, one day after the referendum passed for Saddle River.[21] The name of the river, and hence the borough, is thought to come from early explores who thought that the geography of the area resembled that of the Sadle Burn, the valley surrounding a stream in the Scottish area of Argyll.[22][23][24] Geography[edit] According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 5.281 square miles (13.680 km2), including 5.261 square miles (13.627 km2) of land and 0.020 square miles (0.053 km2) of water (0.39%).[1][2] The borough is bisected by the Saddle River, a tributary of the Passaic River. Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the township include Duffys Mills, Hoppers Mills and Posts Mills.[25] Upper Saddle River is bounded by seven municipalities: Montvale, Saddle River, Ramsey, and Mahwah, as well as small portions of Woodcliff Lake in Bergen County, New Jersey, and Chestnut Ridge and Airmont in the Town of Ramapo in Rockland County, New York.[26] The borough is served by several major highways, including the Garden State Parkway at exits 172 and 171 in Montvale and Woodcliff Lake, and Route 17, which runs through the borough, though some portions of Upper Saddle River are served by roads located in Saddle River, Ramsey and Mahwah.

The governing body consists of a Mayor and a Borough Council comprising six council members, with all positions elected at-large. A Mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The Borough Council consists of six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle.[7] The Borough form of government used by Upper Saddle River, the most common system used in the state, is a "weak mayor / strong council" government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.[40][41] As of 2016[update], the Mayor of Upper Saddle River is Republican Joanne L. Minichetti, whose term of office ends December 31, 2019.
