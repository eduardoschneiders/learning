A popular demand for a kind of university which can reach out to a large number of students desiring higher education in this vast region has always been intensely felt but has never been fulfilled. In 2001, the then Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina laid the foundations of Rangpur University of Science and Technology. However, later on the establishment was cancelled. It was not until August 2007 when Fakhruddin Ahmed, Chief Advisor of the Caretaker Government, agreed in principle to establish a full-fledged university in Rangpur.[4] Finally, Fakhruddin Ahmad, in a historic cabinet meeting held in Rangpur on February 2, 2008, took the decision to establish a University in Rangpur. The Rangpur University Ordinance was approved by the cabinet on June 15, 2008.[5] M. Lutfar Rahman was appointed the first vice chancellor on 20 October 2008. Two days later Hossain Zillur Rahman, the then Education and Commerce Advisor to the Caretaker Government formally inaugurated the university.
